## BOY HAMLET:
To be, or not to be…
---
## BOY HAMLET:
I there’s the point,
---
## BOY HAMLET:
To Die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all:
---
## BOY HAMLET:
No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes,
---
## BOY HAMLET:
For in that dream of death, when we awake,
---
## BOY HAMLET:
And borne before an everlasting Judge,
---
## BOY HAMLET:
From whence no passenger ever returned.
---
## BURBAGE:
What in the un-muzzled dog-breath was that?
---
## BURBAGE:
That wasn’t Hamlet, that fobbing hackery.
---
## BURBAGE:
That was a defilement…I have been defiled.
---
## ALICE:
All right, Burbage.
---
## BURBAGE:
I have been defiled.
---
## JOHN:
It was awful, Alice.
---
## HENRY:
So very awful.
---
## HENRY:
I was not enough prepared for that level of mediocrity.
---
## JOHN:
And I was not enough drunk.
---
## ALICE:
I told you not to go.
---
## ALICE:
I said it’d make you mad.

I heard they sold out both days.

## JOHN:
That’s what makes me mad.
---
## BURBAGE:
Just because that little froth can hold a skull he thinks he can play Hamlet?
---
## BURBAGE:
My soul is written into that part and I’ll play The Prince till I die, and after that?
---
## BURBAGE:
They better use my skull for Yorrick so I can spend eternity silently judging all else.
---
## ALICE:
You could’ve left before he boiled over.
---
## HENRY:
We did, right after Ophelia giggled his way through Act Three.
---
## ALICE:
Giggled?

--
## HENRY: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BURBAGE:
*Giggled.*
---
## BURBAGE:
Those pillagers of wit and charlatans of heart.
---
## ALICE:
That’s what I hate most, the thievery of it.
---
## ALICE:
They just steal the words.
---
## JOHN:
I wish they stole the words.
---
## JOHN:
They just steal the title and Will’s name and make up the rest.
---
## HENRY:
Of all the piracies of Will’s work this one was the worst.
---
## ALICE:
Worse than the Two Gentlemen of Antwerp?
---
## HENRY: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BURBAGE:
*The worst.*
---
## BURBAGE:
Now?
---
## BURBAGE:
I’m going to have to kill that kid.
---
## BURBAGE:
First I’m going to kill the hack that pirated our play, 
---
## BURBAGE:
then I’m going to kill the pimple that played my part,
---
## BURBAGE:
and just for shits and giggles, 
---
## BURBAGE:
I’m killing Ophelia, too.
---
## ALICE:
Hasn’t that girl been through enough?
---
## BURBAGE:
It was blasphemy and they must be punished.
---
## JOHN:
We shall spare you the description of Gertrude.
---
## HENRY:
The lady doth protest so very much, methinks.
---
## HENRY:
Did they not read the part where he says, “Do not saw the air too much with your hand”?
---
## HENRY:
Act Two.
---
## JOHN: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BURBAGE:
*—Act Three.*
---
## HENRY:
Act Three.
---
## HENRY:
And here the simpering thing is extricating the logs of an unseen forest.
---
## JOHN:
And yet the people pay.
---
## JOHN:
For rubbish!
---
## HENRY:
If I’d known that I wouldn’t have worked so hard all this time.
---
## ALICE:
They pay because it says Shakespeare.
---
## BURBAGE:
That’s not Shakespeare, that’s shit wrapped in roses.
---
## ALICE:
I mean if they’re going to steal the scripts, why don’t they at least steal them correctly?
---
## HENRY:
Because they send those damn boys, who have neither patience nor understanding, 
---
## HENRY:
to *copy* the shows while we *perform* them.
---
## BURBAGE:
I’ll kill the boys, too.
---
## ALICE:
That’s it, I’m cutting you off.
---
## BURBAGE:
You do, and the king’ll hear of it.
---
## ALICE:
It’s not the king I’m worried about, Burbage.
---
## ALICE:
It’s your wife.
---
## ALICE:
Winny will have my hide if I send you back to her like this.
---
## BURBAGE:
My Winnifred…Henry’s Liz…your mother…
---
## BURBAGE:
They saw us play these parts with our hearts on fire.
---
## BURBAGE:
They saw the first Hamlet that ever was.
---
## BURBAGE:
They know what’s lost with this pirating.
---
## BURBAGE:
What cold wind blows when mice attempt to play lions.
---
## BURBAGE:
You do, too.
---
## BURBAGE:
You remember your father onstage, I know you do.
---
## ALICE:
Strutting and fretting.
---
## ALICE:
Yes I do.
---
## JOHN:
All right, Burbage.
---
## HENRY:
A lion indeed…
---
## HENRY:
That you were, John.
---
## JOHN:
That was a long time ago.
---
## ALICE:
I wish you’d play again, Dad.
---
## ALICE:
I really do.
---
## JOHN:
Oh, stop it, all of you.
---
## BURBAGE:
We lost one of our best when you quit.
---
## JOHN:
I didn’t quit.
---
## JOHN:
We needed a manager more than a Polonius.
---
## JOHN:
Now we play the palace monthly.
---
## JOHN:
That took more than Burbage’s fame.
---
## JOHN:
It took fiscal sanity…
--
and you’re welcome.
---
## ALICE:
We just mean you were good.
---
## HENRY:
Very good.
---
## BURBAGE:
*Pretty* good.
---
template: noise
(laughter)
---
## ALICE:
Well, no matter how the mice skitter, it’s you that play to packed houses.
---
## ALICE:
You, the King’s favorite, you, who roar.
---
## ALICE:
You are all lions of the boards to this day and no hack Hamlet will change that.
---
## HENRY:
No…’tis we ourselves will do it.
---
## HENRY:
We are not young.
---
## BURBAGE:
Aye.
---
## BURBAGE:
Performances end.
---
## BURBAGE:
So do actors.
---
## HENRY:
Theatre is lived, not kept.
---
## HENRY:
It sleeps when we do.
---
## JOHN:
Well, said, Condi.
---
## JOHN:
Now shut up, you’re making me feel old.
---
## BURBAGE:
You are old.
---
## HENRY:
We all are.
---
## ALICE:
All right you triplets of gloom.
---
## ALICE:
You’re none of you King Lear yet.
---
## HENRY: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BURBAGE:
*Lear!*
---
## BURBAGE:
God bless *The Tragedy of King Lear*.
---
## HENRY:
The best thing I’ve ever seen in my life.
---
## JOHN:
The hush of the crowd—
--
silent—
---
## ALICE:
Neither bird nor bell as Burbage leans over his Cordelia…
---
## BURBAGE:
“Look on her! Look!”
---
## BURBAGE:
“Her lips!”
---
## BURBAGE:
“Look there! Look there…”
---
## HENRY:
A flood of weeping. 
---
## HENRY:
The whole Globe weeping.
---
## HENRY:
But *silent*.
---
## JOHN:
What a thing it was.
---
## BURBAGE:
I thought they hated it at first.
---
## BURBAGE:
“Why aren’t you wailing, groundlings?”
---
## BURBAGE:
“You are witness to a goddamn masterpiece.”
---
## ALICE:
No…
--
No, they were with you every minute.
---
## ALICE:
They always were.
---
## ALICE:
Maybe not for *Titus*.
---
## JOHN:
*Titus* sold well.
---
## HENRY:
Titus!
---
## BURBAGE:
Mayhem and gore always do.
---
## HENRY:
But *Merry Wives* sold the better than all of them.
---
## HENRY:
Your Falstaff, John?
---
## ALICE:
Yes! Falstaff!
---
## HENRY:
The Queen heard the laughs from The Globe in her bed that night.
---
## ALICE:
The people loved it.
---
## ALICE:
They followed you for weeks, Dad.
---
## JOHN:
“When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.”
---
## ALICE:
Mother loved you in that one.
---
## ALICE:
She always loves a comedy.
---
## BURBAGE:
Wait now, his Falstaff?
---
## BURBAGE:
My Henry!
---
## BURBAGE:
My Othello!
---
## ALICE:
Let’s not act that one out in the bar shall we?
---
## BURBAGE:
I will tell you right now that I was not Burbage when we played it… 
---
## BURBAGE:
I *was* Othello.
---
## BURBAGE:
The blood in mine eyes—the palpating heart.
---
## HENRY:
The best time I had in any play?
---
## HENRY:
You’re going to laugh.
---
## HENRY:
Being backstage for the beginning of *The Tempest?*
---
## HENRY:
The storm at sea?
---
## BURBAGE:
THE STORM!
---
## BURBAGE:
God, I wish he wrote more storms.
---
## ALICE:
I might have rattled some pots backstage for that.
---
## JOHN:
You did indeed my dear.
---
## HENRY:
And your Prospero.
---
## BURBAGE:
“Blow wind! Come, wrack!”
---
## BURBAGE:
“At least we’ll die with harness on our back.”
---
## JOHN: 
##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HENRY:
##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALICE:
That’s from Macbeth.
---
## BURBAGE: (covering)
I know it’s from Macbeth…
--
*I played Macbeth*!
---
## BURBAGE:
And I’ll play it again right now.
---
## BURBAGE:
Who wants to be a witch?
---
## HENRY:
You know my favorite was always *Pericles*.
---
## JOHN:
*Pericles*?
---
## ALICE:
Which one was *Pericles*?
---
## HENRY:
With the King and the daughter and the riddle that he figures out and then leaves on a boat and—
---
## HENRY:
There’s a storm in it, I thought you’d like it.
---
## BURBAGE:
Is there a wizard?

--
## HENRY:
Never mind.
---
## JOHN:
I thought Wilkins wrote that.

## HENRY:
I said never mind.

That’s the only way you get to tell everyone else what to do.

At least someone knows them.

I can tell you the stories, but I can’t remember the lines.

## ELIZABETH:
Join me and your mum tomorrow, Ali?
---
## ELIZABETH:
Take your mind off it all?
---
## ALICE:
Would that I could.
---
## ALICE:
The theatre needs ale and apples… 
---
## ALICE:
and I clean up and carry on.
---
## JOHN:
Becky, I think Henry should speak, n-n-
--
not me.
---
## REBECCA:
What’s this?
---
## REBECCA:
No, John, you must.
---
## JOHN:
Henry can do it just fine, and I—
---
## JOHN:
I c-c-
--
can’t.
---
## REBECCA:
John, *you’re* head of The King’s Men now.
---
## REBECCA:
You’re the one they want to hear from 
---
## REBECCA:
and no one will mind if…*your heart*… gets the best of your speech.
---
## JOHN:
*I *will mind.
---
## JOHN:
Henry!
---
## REBECCA:
John.
---
## JOHN:
I will mind.
---
## ALICE:
What’s wrong with Dad?
---
## REBECCA:
You know him.
---
## REBECCA:
If he can’t do it perfectly, he’ll not do it at all.
---
## ALICE:
Ah yes.
---
## ALICE:
His best and worst quality.

---
## HENRY:
Gathered friends.
---
## HENRY:
In our mourning we honor the great man Richard Burbage.
---
## HENRY:
A man who lived so many lives on stages across this country that all of England pauses in their pain today.
---
## HENRY:
We who knew him well…
---
## HENRY:
will never know another of his kindness, his caliber, and his art.
---
## HENRY:
And now, the Poet Laureate of England, Master Ben Jonson, has requested a chance to speak.
---
## ALICE:
That’s nice of him.
---
## ALICE:
He usually doesn’t ask permission.
---
## REBECCA:
Hush, Ali.
---
## BEN:
My compatriots.
---
## BEN:
Burbage was a giant of these boards.
---
## BEN:
The speech he lifted from page to air was honeyed and wise.
---
## BEN:
Silence did not suit him.
---
## BEN:
So I know that Heaven is full of laughter and speech tonight.
---
## BEN:
Do not rest in peace, good friend.
---
## BEN:
Rest in sound and fury.
---
## BEN:
I have penned a eulogy that I shall be humbled to recite anon.
---
## ALICE:
That *wasn’t* the eulogy?

## JOHN:
…How?
---
## JOHN:
How how how is another one of us gone?
---
## HENRY:
Goodnight, sweet prince.
---
## ELIZABETH:
He wasn’t that sweet.
---
## ELIZABETH:
He’d be the first to admit it.
---
## ALICE:
True.
---
## HENRY:
Goodnight, proud, loud, and rowdy prince.
---
## REBECCA:
That’s more like it.
---
## ALICE:
Certainly the Burbage I knew.
---
## HENRY:
To good men, and good players.
---
## JOHN:
With good wives.
---
## JOHN:
Such good wives.
---
## BEN:
*Ale*wives…
--
they’re the ones you can count on.
---
## BEN:
I’m looking at you.
---
## ALICE:
Please don’t.
---
## BEN:
Can’t help it.
---
## ALICE:
Please try.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I thought you didn’t believe in love, Ben.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Your plays don’t.
---
## BEN:
There is rational love and there is heedless passion,
---
## BEN:
and only one of those is worth enshrining in literature.
---
## ALICE:
And only one of those is worth watching on stage, 
---
## ALICE:
which is exactly why Will outdid you.
---
## BEN:
Out-*what*?
---
## BEN:
He never outdid me in all my life, that untrained populist.
c
A poet of the heart always beats a scholar.
---
## ALICE:
No highborn Latin rationalism can grip like a story of passion, 
---
## ALICE:
of men and women alight with revenge or love or loss.
---
## ALICE:
You wrote for professors…
---
## ALICE:
He wrote for people.
---
## ALICE:
And for good or ill the latter rule the world I live in.
---
## HENRY:
I’ll drink to that and so would Burbage.
---
## BEN:
Marry me.
---
## ALICE:
Aren’t you already married?
---
## BEN:
Probably.
---
## ALICE:
To be so smart, Ben, 
--
you are so ridiculous.
---
## BEN:
You know it’s only because I secretly love you that you get to talk to me that way.
---
## REBECCA:
Move away from my daughter, Ben.
---
## REBECCA:
I like your plays but not your reputation.
---
## BEN:
I did not kill that man…
---
## BEN:
and if I did, it was a long time ago.
---
## BEN:
I’m going to bed.
---
## JOHN:
Leaving us so soon, Ben?
---
## BEN:
Yes, I am, because life is short and shitty,
---
## BEN:
and your daughter won’t give me any more beer,
---
## BEN:
and when friends and art are lost, 
---
## BEN:
what’s left for men to seek but God and hops?
---
## HENRY:
Only one of those is supposed to answer prayers.
---
## BEN:
Oh, shut up, Henry.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Do you need help home, Ben?
---
## BEN:
I just walked to Scotland and back, I can walk up the street.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Why’d you walk to Scotland, Ben?
---
## BEN:
Because I’m a man and I felt like it, and I did it,
---
## BEN:
and Will and Burbage and every good man is dying before our eyes
---
## BEN:
and I’m tired. 
--
And goodnight.
---
## ALICE:
Always a pleasure, that one.
---
## JOHN:
What now, Ben?
---
## BEN:
Did I tell you that I love you?
---
## ALICE:
You did.
---
## BEN:
Secretly?
---
## ALICE:
You did.
---
## BEN:
All right, then.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I’ll retire as well, Henry.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Sans pageant.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Good night all and God bless.
---
## HENRY:
Wait, wait, wait, my dear.
---
## HENRY:
I just…
---
## HENRY:
I must say how lost and low I would be without you.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I know, my love.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Don’t stay up too late.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Funerals always make them so sweet.
---
## REBECCA:
Wait, Liz, I’m off as well.
---
## REBECCA:
The morning is nigh and I can neither spoil the children nor the produce.
---
## REBECCA:
See your father finds a bed at some point.
---
## REBECCA:
Good night and God rest his soul.
---
## JOHN:
Goodnight, my dear.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Becky, I found a book of poems at the stalls last week…
--
by a woman poet no less.
---
## REBECCA:
A woman?
---
## ELIZABETH:
I know.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Do you remember Lady Lanier?
---
## REBECCA:
Lady Lanier…
---
## ALICE:
Bassano you mean?
---
## ALICE:
Emilia Bassano?
---
## REBECCA:
The Lord Chamberlain’s mistress, ages ago.
---
## ALICE:
*Will’s* mistress, I thought?
---
## ELIZABETH:
Not in the end she wasn’t.
---
## REBECCA:
Oh yes, I remember all the trouble she caused for Will.
---
## ALICE:
You mean the *sonnets* she caused for Will.
---
## ELIZABETH:
“The Dark Lady”, he called her.
---
## REBECCA:
Always thought that was a bit dramatic.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Yes, well, now she’s written something of her own and it’s quite good.
---
## ELIZABETH:
We’ll read them tomorrow and lift this fog of sorrow for a bit.
---
## ALICE:
Take a break from drama for poetry.
---
## ELIZABETH:
We are wives of actors, dear.
---
## REBECCA:
There are no breaks from either.
---
## JOHN:
What was that darling?
---
## REBECCA: (rapidly)
Nothing—I love you—goodnight!

I don’t know how men do it without good women.
---
## JOHN:
Do what?
---
## HENRY:
Exactly.
---
## JOHN:
All right. One more and then to bed.
---
## JOHN:
To Burbage.
---
## HENRY:
…To Burbage.
---
## ALICE:
……To Burbage.
---
## ALICE:
And the stories and souls he kept alive in his head.
---
---
## JOHN:
Blessed word, she’s right.
---
## ALICE:
What?
---
## JOHN:
The speeches!
---
## JOHN:
I didn’t think of that.
---
## JOHN:
God’s light, who knows the speeches now?
---
## HENRY:
God in Heaven, you’re right.
---
## HENRY:
No one knew the plays like he did.
---
## ALICE:
I thought Taylor was learning the leads?
---
## JOHN:
He is, but that’s just plays we’re running now, we have those scripts.
---
## JOHN:
I’m talking about the plays we did ten years ago, twenty years…
---
## JOHN:
Burbage knew all of them.
---
## HENRY:
He did.
---
## HENRY:
What now?
---
## HENRY:
He’s gone… so are the plays.
---
## HENRY:
*What now?*
---
## ALICE:
Wait wait, you must have Will’s old scripts, don’t you?
---
## HENRY:
Do we?
---
## ALICE:
I don’t know.
---
## JOHN:
Of course we do.
---
## JOHN:
Ed’s got to have all the old promptbooks, actors’ sides…he’ll know.
---
## HENRY:
He has to know.
---
## HENRY:
Those words are our life’s work, Burbage’s life’s, Will’s life.
---
## HENRY:
If we don’t find them, they die with us.
---
## JOHN:
We’ll find the plays, Henry.
---
## ALICE:
What’s past is prologue.
---
## ALICE:
Isn’t that right?
---
## ALICE:
Will’s words.
---
## HENRY:
Unless…
--
the prologue is prologue.
---
## ALICE:
What does that mean?
---
## JOHN:
Hasten the point, Henry.
---
## JOHN:
Too late and too drunk for riddles.
---
## HENRY:
What if we gather them?
---
## HENRY:
Collect them all.
---
## HENRY:
Not in a drawer somewhere but in a…
--
a book.
---
## ALICE:
A book?
---
## JOHN:
Of Will’s plays?
---
## HENRY:
Something simple, just to have them all together, so we know they’re safe.
---
## HENRY:
Have Crane pen them on fine paper.
---
## HENRY:
A collection of Will’s work, for us.
---
## JOHN:
It would be nice to see them all again.
---
## HENRY:
Wouldn’t it?
---
## HENRY:
I don’t think Will’d mind.
---
## ALICE:
I think he’d love it.
---
## JOHN:
Aye.
---
## JOHN:
He would.
---
## HENRY:
And…
---
## HENRY:
If we’re going to collect them all in a book anyway we could just…
--
publish them.
---
## JOHN:
Now we’re publishers?
---
## ALICE:
Publish all the plays.
---
## HENRY:
Yes, and not in some cheap quarto like those pirated versions…
---
## HENRY:
*Our* version…the real plays by William Shakespeare set down as they were done by us.
---
## HENRY:
But for everyone.
---
## ALICE:
I don’t know, I think that’s rather brilliant.
---
## JOHN:
Aye, but rather futile.
---
## JOHN:
Henry, it’s scores of plays.
---
## JOHN:
The book would be as big as a log.
---
## JOHN:
And we don’t have the rights to half of them anyway.
---
## HENRY:
Yes, we do.
---
## HENRY:
The King’s Men have the rights to *all* Will’s plays.
---
## HENRY:
He wrote for us.
---
## JOHN:
For performance, not printing.
---
## JOHN:
The rights to print the plays go to whoever prints it first.
---
## JOHN:
sThat’s why there’s so many artless quartos with Will’s name.
---
## HENRY:
Exactly!
---
## HENRY:
We can’t let that be what’s remembered.
---
## HENRY:
We publish the right plays rightly.
---
## HENRY:
We must.
---
## JOHN:
Even if we could get the rights, we don’t have the money to do this.
---
## HENRY:
We can find the money.
---
## JOHN:
You mean *I* can find the money.
---
## HENRY:
Exactly what I meant.
---
## JOHN:
Henry.
---
## HENRY:
John.
---
## HENRY:
Publish or vanish.
---
## HENRY:
That’s the choice I see.
---
## JOHN:
It’s a lovely thought but… 
---
## JOHN:
who would even buy such a volume *if* we managed to do this?
---
## ALICE:
They bought Ben’s plays.
---
## ALICE:
A folio collection of them.
---
## HENRY:
Yes!
---
## HENRY:
We could publish Will’s in folio, too!
---
## ALICE:
Yes!
---
## JOHN:
No! Folio?!
---
## JOHN:
That’s—come on—
---
## JOHN:
I love Will’s work but it’s not a Bible.
---
## JOHN:
And quartos cost a penny…
---
## JOHN:
A folio imprint could be a pound or more.
---
## JOHN:
Who could pay a year’s wages for a book?
---
## JOHN:
Of plays?
---
## JOHN:
No.
---
## JOHN:
In heart I am with you, but desire is not a plan.
---
## HENRY:
Well, it’s the start of one!
---
## HENRY:
You always do this, you always say “no” before you even consider it.
---
## JOHN:
You haven’t thought this through.
---
## JOHN:
What would stop troupes from performing the damn things and giving the King’s Men a run?
---
## ALICE:
Because they’d be terrible.
---
## JOHN:
So were we once.
---
## JOHN:
Upstart crows the lot of us.
---
## HENRY:
All right.
---
## HENRY:
What if other troupes would perform them?
---
## HENRY:
Even better than we would.
---
## HENRY:
But wouldn’t that be grand?
---
## HENRY:
That would be a new kind of success, John.
---
## HENRY:
For the real plays to go on without us.
---
## HENRY:
On and on and on.
---
## ALICE:
They would be…
--
deathless.
---
## JOHN:
When you turn my daughter against me I have very little choice.
---
## HENRY:
Does that mean you’ll do it? For Will?
---
## HENRY:
For we poor players and our tales full of sound and fury—
---
## ALICE:
Signifying everything.
---
## JOHN:
Let me think it through in the daylight.
---
## JOHN:
I didn’t say yes.
---
## HENRY:
But you will.
---
## HENRY:
We’ll go to Ed first thing tomorrow.
---
## HENRY:
You have a golden heart, friend.
---
## JOHN:
And it tends to weigh me down.
---
---
## ED:
*All* the plays?
---
## HENRY:
Aye. Everything by Will, property of The King’s Men.
---
## HENRY:
We’ll take everything you have.
---
## ED:
All right.
---
## ED:
I don’t.
---
## ED:
Crane. Switch to the other.
---
## ED:
It’s been moved up.
---
## CRANE:
Yes sir.
---
## HENRY:
You don’t… what?
---
## ED:
I don’t have them.
---
## ED:
*Crane*.
---
## CRANE:
Here, sir, yes sir.
---
## JOHN:
You hold the promptbooks, Ed, you have to have them.
---
## ED:
Yes, well, I have the ones on our boards right now.
---
## ED:
I don’t have them all.
---
## HENRY:
What does that mean, he wrote dozens of plays for us—
---
## ED:
Yes—
---
## HENRY:
*Four* dozen if you count collaborations.
---
## JOHN:
*Five* if you count rewrites.
---
## HENRY:
*Six* if you add up all the clowns.
---
## HENRY:
That man could fit a clown in anything.
---
## ED:
All of this I know.
---
## HENRY:
Then where are the scripts?
---
## ED:
Marry. We had them.
---
## ED:
But you might recall that rather off-putting fire a few years back…
---
## ED:
Poof!
---
## ED:
Will stopped writing right before the blaze.
---
## ED:
Back to Stratford he goes.
---
## ED:
The cannon effect in *Henry VIII*, to which you might also recall my stern objection, 
---
## ED:
set the whole theatre alight and everything in it.
---
## ED:
What am I to do?
---
## JOHN:
We lost everything?
---
## HENRY:
The first drafts in his own hand?
---
## HENRY:
The originals?
---
## ED:
We almost lost you, Henry.
---
## ED:
Yes, we lost Will’s manuscripts, the promptbooks…
---
## ED:
We had a library of actor sides but, as I said…
---
## ED:
Poof!
---
## ED:
I told Will, I said “no cannons.”
---
## ED:
I said it to his face a hundred times.
---
## HENRY:
Bloody poof and we’re sunk from the start.
---
## JOHN:
Well, which plays do you have, Ed?
---
## ED:
*The Winter’s Tale*, *Hamlet*, *Othello*, and *Henry IV Part Two*.
---
## CRANE:
And *Twelfth Night*.
---
## ED:
And *Twelfth Night*.
---
## ED:
Thank you, Crane.
---
## ED:
How’s that copying coming?
---
## HENRY:
That’s it? That’s all we have?
---
## HENRY:
Five?
---
## ED:
Might be a few more in some of the prop boxes.
---
## CRANE:
I actually think we might…
---
## ED:
I don’t know and I don’t have time.
---
## CRANE:
I mean there’s a chance I could…
---
## HENRY:
You’re supposed to manage the stage, Ed!
---
## ED:
*And you were supposed to manage the cannon.*
---
## JOHN:
All right.
---
## JOHN:
Perhaps we can admit that this project is too much for us.
---
## HENRY:
No…! John?
---
## HENRY:
You’re siding with Ed?
---
## HENRY:
We hate Ed.
---
## ED:
Excuse me?
---
## JOHN:
No we don’t, Ed.
---
## JOHN:
We need Ed.
---
## ED:
Thank you very much.
---
## JOHN:
What we don’t need is an impossible project when we’re trying to run a theatre company.
---
## HENRY:
It’s not impossible!
---
## CRANE:
Improbable, yes, but not impossible.
---
## CRANE:
Sorry.
---
## HENRY:
Just because they scripts aren’t here doesn’t mean there not somewhere.
---
## HENRY:
What about Burbage?
---
## HENRY:
He must’ve kept his sides.
---
## ED:
Probably slept with them round him like cats.
---
## JOHN:
But even Burbage wouldn’t have the whole plays.
---
## JOHN:
He’d just have his character’s lines—
---
## HENRY:
Why the hell did we start doing it that way, anyway?
---
## HENRY:
Every actor gets only his lines?
---
## HENRY:
It’s a mess.
---
## HENRY:
I blame Ed.
---
## ED:
*It wasn’t me.*
---
## JOHN:
It was Will.
---
## JOHN:
Make it harder for other companies to steal it if no one had the whole play.
---
## HENRY:
Well, now we can’t steal our *own* plays from ourselves for ourselves.
---
## CRANE:
But if we can find most of the sides we could piece the shows back together
---
## CRANE:
using our memory and the quartos to fill in the rest.
---
## HENRY:
Yes!
---
## ED:
*Crane*.
---
## JOHN:
NO.
---
## CRANE:
Sorry.
---
## JOHN:
The quartos?
---
## JOHN:
You saw that boy’s Hamlet…most of the quartos are trash.
---
## JOHN:
And, frankly, our memory is worse.
---
## HENRY:
Which is why this is so important.
---
## HENRY:
That *Hamlet* is what’s left if we don’t do this and do it well.
---
## HENRY:
Crane’s right.
---
## HENRY:
We scour the city.
---
## HENRY:
If there are sides in corners and cupboards across London, we’ll find them.
---
## HENRY:
What about Will’s wife? 
---
## HENRY:
Surely there’s something back in Stratford.
---
## CRANE:
He left all his papers here before he retired, but I can write her.
---
## ED:
No, you won’t.
---
## ED:
You’ve got two tragedies and a farce to ready before Friday.
---
## ED:
And the Will I knew would much prefer the show go on.
---
## ED:
Speaking of which, you’re going on for Burbage in an hour, Henry.
---
## HENRY:
We must all “give sorrow words…the grief that does not speak whispers the overfraught heart and bids it break.”
---
## ED:
*Macbeth*, isn’t it?
---
## ED:
Nice.
---
## ED:
Except it’s *Henry IV *today.
---
## ED:
But have Crane pen that bit before you go and we lose it, too.
---
## ED:
Beg your pardon, friends.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t want to lose the plays, either, of course I don’t, 
---
## JOHN:
but if we don’t have the scripts I don’t know what’s to be done?
---
## JOHN:
We’ve got to be reasonable about this—
---
## HENRY:
No, we don’t!
---
## HENRY:
Listen to yourself!
---
## HENRY:
Was it reasonable to start a theatre troupe in the first place?
---
## HENRY:
Was it reasonable to hire a no-name poet who wouldn’t write a play the same way twice?
---
## HENRY:
Was it reasonable build The Globe the first time, 
---
## HENRY:
much less to tear it down, carry it across the Thames in the middle of the night, log by log,
---
## HENRY:
and build it again just to avoid rent?
---
## HENRY:
No!
---
## HENRY:
There is no reason in losing those plays, there is only erosion.
---
## HENRY:
And erosion you can stop.
---
## HENRY:
If you act fast. Now.
---
## HENRY:
I have to go on in one of the few full scripts of Will’s we have left.
---
## HENRY:
After that I’m going to Saint Paul’s to buy every pirated play by William Shakespeare I can find so that I can get to work.
---
## HENRY:
Join me or don’t, but I’m doing this.
---
## CRANE:
Master Condell, I’d be honored to help you.
---
## HENRY:
Thank you, Crane.
---
## HENRY:
Thank you very much.
---
## JOHN:
Henry, you go on stage, I’ll go to Saint Pauls…
---
## JOHN:
but don’t say “thank you” because I’m doing this to prove you wrong.
---
## HENRY:
Thank you.
---
## CRIER:
Three plays this week at the Globe Theatre!
---
## CRIER:
One lamentable tragedy of *Othello*, *The Moore of Venice*;
---
## CRIER:
the excellent histories of *Henry the Fourth*;
---
## CRIER:
and the enchanting comedy *Every Man in His Humor*.
---
## CRIER:
Three o’clock in the afternoon!
---
## CRIER:
A penny for the pit!
---
## CRIER:
One penny for a play today!
---
## JOHN:
After a day at the bookstalls with the dregs of the publishing trade, I am sick with ink.
---
## HENRY:
But what did you find?
---
## HENRY:
What plays?
---
## ALICE:
Not even half of them.
---
## ALICE:
It’s a start, yes, but—
---
## JOHN:
Half his work is missing and the other half is this poor and pirated rubbish.
---
## HENRY:
Do you see *Pericles*?
---
## JOHN:
*Pericles* again?
---
## ALICE:
Would you leave that play alone?
---
## HENRY:
I happen to like that one.
---
## HENRY:
I like it a lot.
---
## ALICE:
The point is, where’s *Macbeth*?
---
## ALICE:
Where’s *Antony and Cleopatra*?
---
## ALICE:
There’s no quarto for those plays and we don’t have the originals.
---
## ALICE:
They’re gone.
---
## JOHN:
No *Tempest* either.
---
## ALICE:
Or *As You Like it*?
---
## ALICE:
Come on, that’s the best one.
---
## HENRY:
That’s why we’re doing this.
---
## HENRY:
Not just for Will or Burbage.
---
## HENRY:
For Orlando and Prospero and Banquo—
---
## ALICE:
Yes, and Lady Macbeth, Rosalind, Viola.
---
## ALICE:
They’re why I came to the theatre at all.
---
## ALICE:
His women, they spoke, they loved, they got to be evil.
---
## ALICE:
But Dad’s right, it’s not worth doing if you don’t find them all.
---
## JOHN:
And I don’t see how we can.
---
## JOHN:
We don’t have money, or rights, or half the damn plays.
---
## JOHN:
What and how are we going print anyway?
---
## REBECCA:
John! Look what I found.
---
## REBECCA:
Look here.
---
## ALICE:
What did you find, mum?
---
## JOHN:
What’s there, darling?
---
## REBECCA:
I was ruminating about your project and I thought…
---
## REBECCA:
…the basket in the chest in the closet!
---
## REBECCA:
And sure enough, I found some of your sides, John.
---
## REBECCA:
Falstaff!
---
## REBECCA:
I’ll admit to mostly keeping the funny ones.
---
## ALICE:
*You threw some out?*
---
## REBECCA:
Well, I didn’t know we’d need them fifteen years later,
---
## REBECCA:
and a house full of paper and children is quite the fire hazard, thank you very much.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you for this, Becky.
---
## HENRY:
Yes! See?
---
## HENRY:
Thank you for keeping what you did.
---
## HENRY:
Thank you.
---
## ALICE: (under her breath)
Threw out Shakespeare…
---
## REBECCA:
All right, you.
---
## REBECCA:
It’s not Oxford.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Henry, Henry, Henry!
---
## ELIZABETH:
I found some of your parts at home—Mercutio and Horatio.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Becky was right, check near the privy.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Oh! And Burbage’s widow found his Hamlet and Othello, and his mistress gave me Richard!
---
## HENRY:
This is excellent, my love, thank you.
---
## ALICE:
Thank you, Liz!
---
## ELIZABETH:
The mistress said she might also have his Antony and Lear somewhere too.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I’m going back tomorrow.
---
## HENRY:
Well, thank god for mistresses.
---
## HENRY:
And happily married husbands.
---
## HENRY:
Deeply happy—
--
very deep.
---
## REBECCA:
I found Polonius and Oberon, too.
---
## ELIZABETH:
And somehow I’ve got Sam’s Titania.
---
## ALICE:
There starts a pairing.
---
## HENRY:
All right then.
---
## REBECCA:
But who had Puck?
---
## REBECCA:
You can’t do that one without Puck.
---
## JOHN:
I think it was Kemp that played him?
---
## JOHN:
Or… who was it, Condi?
---
## HENRY:
I subbed in once, but—
---
## ELIZABETH:
“If we shadows have offended,”
---
## ELIZABETH:
“Think but this, and all is mended,”
---
## ELIZABETH:
“That you have but slumbered here”
---
## ELIZABETH:
“While these visions did appear.”
---
## HENRY:
Look at that.
---
## REBECCA:
Well, played there, Liz.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Thank you.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I always liked it when it rhymed.
---
## HENRY:
You don’t know the rest of it, do you?
---
## ELIZABETH:
Probably a bit more.
---
## ELIZABETH:
And I memorized most of Beatrice.
---
## REBECCA:
Oh, me too.
---
## REBECCA:
She was my favorite.
---
## REBECCA:
“Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?”

## CRANE:
Masters.
---
## CRANE:
Good evening.
---
## CRANE:
I—
--
well—
--
you must forgive me but—
---
## HENRY:
Speak, Crane.
---
## HENRY:
What is it?
---
## CRANE:
Now I know it was mostly wrong of me, but I swear I didn’t mean any harm, I just—
---
## HENRY:
What, what, what is it, man?
---
## CRANE:
All the Shakespeare I could find.
---
## CRANE :
Please don’t sack me.
---
## CRANE :
Master Knight didn’t know I kept them.
---
## CRANE :
I wasn’t supposed to, but I made copies of my favorites.
---
## CRANE :
Just for private reading and study.
---
## ALICE:
*Cymbeline*, *Antony*, *Lear*, *Caesar*…
---
## HENRY:
Oh my God, Crane, I could kiss you.
---
## CRANE:
Thank you, let’s not.
---
## REBECCA:
*Tempest*, *Two Gents*, *King John*.
---
## CRANE:
I had a lot of favorites.
---
## HENRY:
Blessed heaven you did!
---
## HENRY:
John, do you see this?
---
## ELIZABETH:
*Merry Wives*, *Measure for Measure*, *Taming of the Shrew*…
---
## ALICE:
*As You Like It!*
---
## ALICE:
As much as you can drink, Master Crane!
---
## ALICE:
On the house!
---
## JOHN:
No, it’s not.
---
## ALICE:
*On the house.*
---
## CRANE:
That’s very kind, but I just want to keep the job.
---
## HENRY:
You will.
---
## HENRY:
And you just earned another.
---
## JOHN:
What other?
---
## HENRY:
Editor of the Collected Plays of William Shakespeare.
---
## HENRY:
You’ve seen more of Will’s hand than anyone alive, I’d wager.
---
## JOHN:
Henry, wait now, we haven’t agreed to all this yet.
---
## HENRY:
But we have the plays, John!
---
## HENRY:
Full scripts, not part-by-part, not shite quartos.
---
## HENRY:
We have the actual plays now.
---
## JOHN:
*Some* of them.
---
## JOHN:
And not all the rights and not the funding and not the—
---
## JOHN:
the time and the knowledge, and—
---
## JOHN:
We don’t know what we’re doing, and even if we did, 
---
## JOHN:
it would still be mostly insane to try.
---
## REBECCA:
He’ll do it.
---
## JOHN:
*Becky*.
---
## REBECCA:
John. You’ll do this like you do everything else.
---
## JOHN:
And how is that?
---
## ALICE:
How is that?
---
## REBECCA:
With a sometimes charming but always robust blend of reason, fortitude, and guile.
---
## REBECCA:
I love you.
---
## REBECCA:
Get to work.
---
## JOHN:
And now you leave me?
---
## REBECCA:
I said get to work.
---
## REBECCA:
We’ve all got to.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I hope you look at me like that when I leave a room.
---
## HENRY:
Usually.
---
## HENRY:
Always.
---
## JOHN:
All right, Condi.
---
## JOHN:
Let’s give this damn thing a try.
---
.char[
## ALICE:

Yes, Dad! Yes!

Heart of gold, I always said.

Isn’t this exciting?

## BEN: (angrily)
CONDELL.
---
## HENRY:
What, ho, Ben.
---
## HENRY:
Join us!
---
## ELIZABETH:
Master Jonson, we’re toasting!
---
## JOHN:
Welcome, Ben.
---
## JOHN:
A pint for the poet?
---
## ALICE:
Pint?
---
## JOHN:
True.
---
## JOHN:
Better just put a stool under the tap for him.
---
## BEN:
*What in high shit do you think you’re doing?*
---
## HENRY:
Well… 
---
## HENRY:
presently we celebrate John finally coming to his senses, 
---
## HENRY:
and Master Crane and his marvelous deception.
---
## CRANE:
Private study, I said.
---
## BEN:
Deception indeed.
---
## BEN:
You publish Will’s work without my knowledge?
---
## BEN:
*Without my knowledge?*
---
## JOHN:
Publish it?
---
## JOHN:
No.
---
## HENRY:
Yes, we are.
---
## HENRY:
Now we are!
---
## JOHN:
But we haven’t even started.
---
## BEN:
And yet I hold in my hand ten so-called plays by William Shakespeare.
---
## BEN:
A new collection on which I was neither consulted nor alerted…so I will repeat…
---
## BEN:
*What in high shit is this*?
---
## JOHN:
What the devil?
---
## CRANE:
Ten plays?
---
## ELIZABETH:
A collection of Shakespeare.
---
## HENRY:
Who printed this?
---
## CRANE:
It says William Jaggard.
---
## JOHN:
*Jaggard*?
---
## ALICE:
The one who does the playbills?
---
## HENRY:
The one who’s been making money off of Will’s name for decades, 
---
## HENRY:
printing false work and calling it his.
---
## BEN:
So you did not approve this, then?
---
## JOHN:
Of course we did not.
---
## HENRY:
With Jaggard printing?
---
## HENRY:
Not till the core of the earth has rotted out would I work with that liar.
---
## JOHN:
He was one of the few men Will disliked.
---
## HENRY:
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALICE: 
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIZABETH:
Hated.
---
## BEN:
I know that, John, that’s why I came here to throttle you.
---
## ALICE:
Sometimes you were on the list as well, Ben.
---
## BEN:
Oh, now, Will’s and mine was a friendly rivalry.
---
## BEN:
Poet against poet.
---
## BEN:
Battle of wits, not fists.
---
## ALICE:
Unless you drank, which you always do.
---
## ALICE:
And I cleaned up your broken bottles after your “friendly rivalries.”
---
## BEN:
I take no heed from a barmaid.
---
## HENRY:
I thought he loved her?
---
## ELIZABETH:
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEN:
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALICE:
He does.
---
## CRANE:
Um…the book?
---
## CRANE:
The table lists *Lear*, *Merchant*, *Merry Wives*, *Pericles,* but also—
---
## HENRY:
*They printed* Pericles?
---
## JOHN:
Calm down, man.
---
## CRANE:
But also plays I know aren’t his.
---
## CRANE:
*A Yorkshire Tragedy*?
---
## ALICE:
*A Yorkshire* what?
---
## HENRY:
The man already published crap sonnets under Will’s name…
---
## HENRY:
crap quartos under Will’s name…
---
## HENRY:
and now this.
---
## HENRY:
I will not stand for it.
---
## JOHN:
And who would buy our book with that one out first?
---
## CRANE:
I’m fairly sure Jaggard doesn’t have the rights to half of these plays anyway.
---
## CRANE:
He just prints what he likes no matter who owns them.
---
## BEN:
Oh really?
---
## JOHN:
He does, does he?
---
## CRANE:
I heard he’s reprinting old quartos and calling them first editions so he can sell more books.
---
## CRANE:
That man survives through forgiveness, not permission.
---
## BEN:
Not anymore he doesn’t.
---
## HENRY:
What’s this now?
---
## BEN:
John knows what we have to do to crush the man and his lies.
---
## JOHN:
Aye.
---
## JOHN:
Our very good friend, The Lord Chamberlain, 
---
## JOHN:
needs to know there’s a peddler of theft and malfeasance at the Jaggard Print House.
---
## BEN:
And that Ben Jonson doesn’t like it.
---
## REBECCA:
Apples! Pears! Figs and nuts!
---
## REBECCA:
The freshest!
---
## REBECCA:
Apples! Pears! Figs and nuts!
---
## HENRY:
Light has triumphed over darkness!
---
## HENRY:
Good over evil!
---
## HENRY:
And all here shall know that chicanery hath been vanquished on this day!
---
## ELIZABETH:
My goodness, Henry, what play is that?
---
## HENRY:
No play, my glorious wife. 
---
## HENRY:
*Today,* life is better than drama!
---
## ELIZABETH: (sarcastically)
Noooo…
---
## HENRY:
Yes!
---
## HENRY:
Ben went to the Lord Chamberlain to flatten the Old Jaggard for printing Will’s work without the rights
---
## HENRY:
and they stopped the presses today!
---
## ELIZABETH:
Stopped them today?
---
## HENRY:
They are stopped!
---
## HENRY:
And Ben tells us that Jaggard played the fool.
---
## HENRY:
“Oh sire, I did not know the rights were in question.”
---
## HENRY:
Horseshit—
---
## ELIZABETH:
Henry.
---
## HENRY:
He knew exactly what he was doing, do not be fooled.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I’m not fooled and you’re not sleeping in my bed with that language.
---
## HENRY:
I love you my darling but you cannot stop glee from arising as it will.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Please inform your glee that it needs to behave like a gentleman.
---
## HENRY:
The gentlemen won today!
---
## HENRY:
We are free to print our book the way it should be printed.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Will’s book.
---
## HENRY:
What?
---
## ELIZABETH:
It’s *Will’s* book, isn’t it?
---
## HENRY:
With him gone, and a legacy on the line?
---
## HENRY:
We are Will.
---
## JOHN:
What a day, my dear, a day that ends a week that ends a month of this tiresome business.
---
## REBECCA:
What’s this shadow about?
---
## REBECCA:
I thought you and Ben sorted it all out?
---
## JOHN:
We did.
---
## JOHN:
He’s not very pleasant company but he is profoundly affective at getting what he wants.
---
## JOHN:
So…the Jaggard book is stopped, but…
---
## REBECCA:
What? Is this not good news?
---
## JOHN:
Yes, but I don’t know if I can weather the constant storms to get this book done, 
---
## JOHN:
and it looks like the waves won’t stop coming.
---
## JOHN:
It’s one thing after another, and I don’t know if I can do it.
---
## REBECCA:
Of course you can, if anyone can, you can.
---
## REBECCA:
Your sails are stronger than anyone’s.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t need encouragement right now, I need support.
---
## REBECCA:
Support you quitting?
---
## JOHN:
I’m not quitting!
---
## REBECCA:
It sounds like you’re quitting.
---
## REBECCA:
But this book is a good idea and a good deed.
---
## JOHN:
Well, it’s also impossible.
---
## REBECCA:
It’s not, it’s…
--
*nearly* impossible.
---
## JOHN:
Nearly, yes, thank you, and every day it gets more so.
---
## JOHN:
And I fear after all the work and the time away from you and the children and the theater and the church…
---
## JOHN:
After all that time we will have nothing to show for it…
---
## JOHN:
I will have nothing to show for it.
---
## REBECCA:
John—
---
## JOHN:
Failing them is worse than losing them.
---
## REBECCA:
Well, you can’t help losing friends, but you can and must try to honor them.
---
## JOHN:
I am not young.
---
## REBECCA:
You’re also not dead.
---
## JOHN:
But everyone who should be doing this work instead of me already is.
---
## HENRY:
Now that we can do this, we must!
---
## HENRY:
If we do not, who will?
---
## ELIZABETH:
Oh please, darling, I’m not dissuading you. 
---
## ELIZABETH:
I think the book is a fine idea and a brilliant tribute.
---
## ELIZABETH:
But you need to watch the money.
---
## ELIZABETH:
We want to be *investing* in this book, not donating.
---
## HENRY:
We’ll work out the deal when we have the partners.
---
## HENRY:
Right now we drink!
---
## ELIZABETH:
You need to think of it now.
---
## ELIZABETH:
And I will not have you do all this work for nothing.
---
## HENRY:
It’s not nothing…it’s pride, it’s love.
---
## HENRY:
It’s not about profit.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Henry.
---
## ELIZABETH:
There no such thing as a business that’s nonprofit.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Now before you sign any papers let me read them. 
---
## ELIZABETH:
I want a return and a percentage of the earnings.
---
## HENRY:
I love it when you talk business.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I know you do.
---
## HENRY:
I get swept away with the heart of a thing.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I know you do.
---
## HENRY:
And now I need to kiss my beautiful wife.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Nothing in your way that I see.
---
## REBECCA:
All right.
---
## REBECCA:
Yes.
---
## REBECCA:
This is mostly absurd and rather improbable, and you’re not even publishers.
---
## JOHN:
Exactly.
---
## REBECCA:
And the project is enormous and costly and it is all on your head 
---
## REBECCA:
because this theatre has come to depend on you for its very life.
---
## JOHN:
Yes. *Yes*.
---
## REBECCA:
But not its art.
---
## REBECCA:
You gave up the stage, the stage you loved, the stage that made you and made you alive,
---
## REBECCA:
to make The King’s Men great…
---
## REBECCA:
And they are…
---
## REBECCA:
*You* are.
---
## REBECCA:
That’s why you have to do this.
---
## REBECCA:
That book is…
---
## REBECCA:
It’s *you*.
---
## REBECCA:
Those plays are you at your best.
---
## REBECCA:
You gave up what you loved once, I won’t let you do it again.
---
## JOHN:
I’ve already put my life into this theater, I don’t know if I can put the rest into a book.
---
## REBECCA:
A theater is an empty thing.
---
## REBECCA:
A theater you fill up with words.
---
## ALICE:
Dad.
---
## ALICE:
We need to talk about this.
---
## JOHN:
Ali, not now.
---
## ALICE:
Dad, this book is—
---
## JOHN:
I know what it is, and I know what it’s not.
---
## JOHN:
Half the country can’t read, the other half can’t pay.
---
## JOHN:
The paper alone is worth the whole theater and I’m not bankrupting The King’s Men for this.
---
## ALICE:
There’s a way.
---
## REBECCA:
There must be.
---
## JOHN:
*There’s not, I’m telling you there’s not.*
---
## JOHN:
I’m sorry.
---
## JOHN:
I’m tired, Becky.
---
## REBECCA:
So am I.
---
## REBECCA:
I’m tired too, I’m tired after my long days, and I know my lines aren’t grand ones.
---
## REBECCA:
“Apples, pears, figs and nuts.”
---
## REBECCA:
But I say them every day, on cue, with no applause.
---
## REBECCA:
Because not everyone doing good work gets applause.
---
## REBECCA:
And not everyone gets the chance at a legacy.
---
## JOHN:
Is a legacy worth a life?
---
## REBECCA:
You’re damn right it is.
---
## ALICE:
Dad, I can help more if that would—
---
## JOHN:
I’ve tried, I’ve tried, I’ve given it too much already and I’m done.
---
## REBECCA:
Dammit John, that book is mine, too.
---
## REBECCA:
Those plays are mine and Ali’s and your sons’…
---
## REBECCA:
And I should tell you to abandon this thing just so I can have you at home…
---
## REBECCA:
So your children can have you…
---
## REBECCA:
You know, the little people who sleep here at night.
---
## JOHN:
Becky, please—
---
## REBECCA:
I should tell you to drop this whole thing because that would make my life better and probably yours.
---
## REBECCA:
But those plays are not yours and not Will’s and not Burbage’s.
---
## REBECCA:
No, they’re ours and if they are lost to time…
---
## REBECCA:
I’m sorry, my love, but that will be on your head.
---
## REBECCA:
So you will do it.
---
## REBECCA:
Yes, you will.
---
## JOHN:
*All right*, women, all right.
---
## JOHN:
And thank you.
---
## ALICE:
Why don’t you come to the playhouse tomorrow, mum?
---
## ALICE:
I’ll take care of things here, come see a play, have some fun.
---
## REBECCA:
What’s on?
---
## REBECCA:
A comedy?
---
## ALICE:
Actually it is.
---
## ALICE:
And Henry’s in it…
--
he’s not bad.
---
## REBECCA:
Maybe next week.
---
## REBECCA:
Would it were you, I’d go.
---
## REBECCA:
I’d always go see you.
---
---
## HENRY:
Wait a minute, wait, not one printer on Fleet Street is willing?
---
## JOHN:
I went to everyone.
---
## JOHN:
They all say they can’t print such a large project.
---
## JOHN:
I even said we had the money.
---
## ALICE:
Do we?
---
## JOHN:
Of course not.
---
## ALICE:
Well, it has to be folio or else we can’t fit all the plays.
---
## HENRY:
So John is finally on board to print and now we have no printers.
---
## ALICE:
Something’s rotten in that.
---
## JOHN:
Tarry now.
---
## JOHN:
I tried today and I’ll try tomorrow.
---
## JOHN:
Where there’s a will…
---
## JAGGARD:
Good day, gentleman.
---
## JAGGARD:
Do I find any of The King’s Men present here?
---
## JOHN:
You do, sir, but the theater’s entrance is around the corner and I’m afraid the show’s not till three.
---
## JAGGARD:
Thank you lass, but I’m not here for a show.
---
## JAGGARD:
My sight is as useless as a hat on a fish.
---
## ISAAC:
I believe we find Masters Condell and Heminges, do we not?
---
## JOHN:
You do, sir.
---
## JOHN:
And my daughter, Alice.
---
## ISAAC:
Milady.
---
## ALICE:
Oh…
--
welcome…
--
good…
--
sir.
---
## JOHN:
And who are you, sirs?
---
## JAGGARD:
We hope to engage you men in a conversation about the plays of William Shakespeare 
---
## JAGGARD:
of which we hear rumor you are arranging for print.
---
## HENRY:
Yes sir, that we are.
---
## HENRY:
How do you come to know this?
---
## JAGGARD:
I know everything on Fleet Street.
---
## JAGGARD:
I know the cost of paper in Normandy,
---
## JAGGARD:
I know which whores have crabs…
--
most of them…
---
## JAGGARD:
and I know that you are asking every printer in town about some grand project but not me.
---
## ISAAC:
We are printers, sirs.
---
## JAGGARD:
This is my son, Isaac, who manages the presses I have.
---
## JAGGARD:
Large ones, too, folio imprint, and the like.
---
## ALICE:
*Folio?*
---
## JOHN:
Well, we are glad to make your acquaintance.
---
## JOHN:
Please sit.
---
## ALICE:
A drink for you, sir?
---
## ALICE:
Or your son?
---
## ISAAC:
Thank you, milady.
---
## HENRY:
We were great friends of Master Shakespeare
---
## HENRY:
and we have collected a great majority of his work and hope to print the whole of it.
---
## JAGGARD:
You say you have a great many of the man’s plays?
---
## JAGGARD:
How many?
---
## HENRY:
We have eighteen or so all together.
---
## HENRY:
None of them ever printed before.
---
## HENRY:
We have his *Caesar*, *Macbeth*—
---
## ALICE:
*As You Like It.*
---
## JAGGARD:
Well…
---
## JAGGARD:
With my eighteen we could print the lot then, couldn’t we?
---
## HENRY:
*Your* eighteen?
---
## JAGGARD:
That’s right.
---
## JAGGARD:
My eighteen plays by William Shakespeare have been printed by me.
---
## JAGGARD:
So though you managed to shut down my last attempt to publish your friend,
---
## JAGGARD:
I stand here willing to forgive that slight and forge ahead with a complete collection.
---
## HENRY:
No. *No*—
---
## JAGGARD:
William Jaggard, at your service.
---
## HENRY:
OH, FOR GOD’S SAKE.
---
## ALICE:
Henry.
---
## HENRY:
GET OUT, YOU DOG.
---
## JOHN:
*Henry*.
---
## HENRY:
He comes here to forgive us?!
---
## HENRY:
*To forgive us?*
---
## ISAAC:
No, please, I can explain—
---
## JAGGARD:
You stopped my presses, you cost me coin.
---
## JAGGARD:
I could sue you for damages—
---
## HENRY:
You stole those plays, which you had no right to print nor call Will’s!
---
## JAGGARD:
Poets don’t have rights, not to their names and not to their work.
---
## JAGGARD:
It’s business, friends, no harm in it.
---
## JOHN:
There is harm in deceit, there is always harm in that.
---
## ISAAC:
Yes, and we only want to make it right—
---
## JAGGARD:
What we want to make is a deal, a partnership between us to create a volume of plays by—
---
## HENRY:
NO. *NO*.
---
## JAGGARD:
If you want to do this, you cannot do it without me.
---
## HENRY:
We can and will.
---
## HENRY:
We don’t need your filthy business.
---
## JAGGARD:
What about the plays to which you have no rights?
---
## ALICE:
You said poets don’t have rights.
---
## JAGGARD:
Well, printers do.
---
## JAGGARD:
And lawyers.
---
## JAGGARD:
And investors.
---
## JAGGARD:
And those are the ones you really don’t want to fuck with.
---
## JOHN:
We’ll get the rights from honest men who want the first and only authorized version of Shakespeare—
---
## JOHN:
As in, the actual author.
---
## JAGGARD:
And how much of that work is there without your friend’s *Hamlet*?
---
## JAGGARD:
Dear old Smethwick owns it—and *Romeo and Juliet*.
---
## JAGGARD:
Gave me the rights to both.
---
## JAGGARD:
What about *Much Ado*?
---
## JAGGARD:
That’s Aspley’s title, already on board.
---
## JAGGARD:
The *Richards*, the *Henrys*…
---
## JAGGARD:
Crowd favorites.
---
## JAGGARD:
All and all mine, and who will buy your collection without them?
---
## JAGGARD:
I wouldn’t.
---
## ISAAC:
Father, *please*.
---
## JAGGARD:
Let me be frank.
---
## JAGGARD:
I know you don’t have the funds to do this.
---
## JAGGARD:
I do.
---
## JAGGARD:
I know you don’t have the means to print.
---
## JAGGARD:
I do.
---
## JAGGARD:
You don’t have the rights to all the plays, 
---
## JAGGARD:
but I have already brought together a syndicate of owners to invest in this folio’s production.
---
## JAGGARD:
Suddenly you have money, rights, texts, presses and nothing in your way 
---
## JAGGARD:
but an old blind man asking to be friends.
---
## JAGGARD:
So…
---
## JAGGARD:
Is there a deal to be made, gentlemen?
---
## HENRY:
Have you ever seen a play of his?
---
## HENRY:
Ever?
---
## JAGGARD:
Aye.
---
## JAGGARD:
*Pericles,* I believe.
---
## JAGGARD:
Didn’t really move me.
---
## HENRY:
You son of a—
---
## ISAAC:
Father, we should go.
---
## ALICE:
Yes, I think you’d better leave, Master Jaggard.
---
## JOHN:
We’ll consider your proposal.
---
## ISAAC:
Thank you, sirs.
---
## HENRY:
NO, WE WILL NOT.
---
## JAGGARD:
You should…
---
## JAGGARD:
until tomorrow, when I start printing *Half The Collected Works of William Shakespeare*.
---
## JAGGARD:
Good day.
---
## JAGGARD:
Isaac.
---
## ALICE:
Well…
---
## ALICE:
We have just confirmed that that man is a leech.
---
## HENRY:
A scheming, dog-hearted liar with terrible taste.
---
## JOHN:
Also with…
--
funding. 
--
Presses. 
--
Experience.
---
## HENRY:
No, John.
---
## HENRY:
We cannot consider it, not for a  moment.
---
## JOHN:
Perhaps we should.
---
## HENRY:
John.
---
## JOHN:
Henry, you cannot keep grudges in business.
---
## HENRY:
This is not that kind of business!
---
## HENRY:
This is our heart on those pages.
---
## JOHN:
And letting it lie fallow is the insult.
---
## JOHN:
Wasn’t that your point when we started this?
---
## HENRY:
Don’t you quote me at me.
---
## HENRY:
This is ridiculous.
---
## HENRY:
Will hated that man for a reason.
---
## HENRY:
He has no scruples, we know for a fact that he doesn’t respect contract.
---
## HENRY:
Why on earth would we think he would respect us, or the work, or—
---
## HENRY:
No—
--
Alice, help me, your father has lost his mind.
---
## ALICE:
I think Jaggard’s a depreciating evil sort of fellow.
---
## HENRY:
*Thank you.*
---
## ALICE:
Who does make a good point.
---
## ALICE:
If the option is to take the risk on him or do nothing…
---
## ALICE:
I’d take it.
---

## HENRY:
Ali.
---
## ALICE:
I would.
---
## ALICE:
It’s worth it to see the work completed.
---
## ISAAC:
Gentlemen, if I may.
---
## HENRY:
*You*.
---
## HENRY:
Tell your father he’s a- a- 
--
what did I say?
---
## ALICE:
Scheming, dog-hearted liar.
---
## HENRY:
…Scheming, dog-hearted liar.
---
## HENRY:
You tell him that to his face.
---
## ISAAC:
Oh, I have.
---
## ISAAC:
Not often, but at least twice in my life.
---
## ISAAC:
He’s a bit of a bastard but he’s damn good at selling books.
---
## HENRY:
Stealing them!
---
## JOHN:
What do you want, son?
---
## ISAAC:
I want you to know that I have seen every play that William Shakespeare ever wrote for The King’s Men,
---
## ISAAC:
which means I saw you both countless times.
---
## ISAAC:
And bought a few dozen apples from you over the years, Mistress Heminges.
---
## ISAAC:
I love the plays and I loved you in them.
---
## ISAAC:
My father is a bit of a dog but I’m not.
---
## ISAAC:
And despite his swagger, I run the shop now.
---
## ISAAC:
And I want to publish these plays as they should be published.
---
## ISAAC:
Cleanly. Rightly.
---
## ALICE:
Handsomely.
---
## ISAAC:
Yes.
---
## ISAAC:
A book that will last.
---
## ISAAC:
If that is what you wish for as well, please consider this partnership.
---
## HENRY:
I don’t trust your father and I don’t trust you.
---
## ISAAC:
Well, it will be my pleasure to earn that from you.
---
## JOHN:
That sounds reasonable to me.
---
## HENRY:
“I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.”
---
## ISAAC:
*Merchant of Venice.*
---
## ISAAC:
Bassanio, if I recall correctly.
---
## JOHN:
I think he’s right about that.
---
## ALICE:
Aye.
---
## HENRY:
I don’t care, John.
---
## HENRY:
They could ruin our plays, run away with them, who knows what!
---
## ISAAC:
I promise you, Master Condell.
---
## ISAAC:
An unrivaled book of unrivaled plays, that’s what I want.
---
## ISAAC:
If you do, too, join us tomorrow.
---
## ISAAC:
At the Half-Eagle-and-Key in Barbican at three.
---
## ISAAC:
You can meet the  other owners, see the presses, hear the plans.
---
## ISAAC:
If we can all agree, we’ll start right away.
---
## JOHN:
Not a word could be altered in any way.
---
## JOHN:
If we work with you, not one word changes without our approval.
---
## ISAAC:
Yes, of course.
---
## ISAAC:
You knew him best.
---
## HENRY:
And Ralph Crane is the editor.
---
## ISAAC:
We have experienced editors in house—
---
## HENRY:
Ralph Crane edits the plays with us.
---
## HENRY:
He copied Will’s hand all his life, he knows what’s right.
---
## ISAAC:
All right. Yes.
---
## ISAAC:
Crane will edit along with the both of you.
---
## ISAAC:
I can see to that.
---
## JOHN:
And you only print what we know to be authored by Will Shakespeare.
---
## HENRY:
None of this *Yorkshire Tragedy* crap.
---
## HENRY:
Anything we don’t approve is out.
---
## ISAAC:
Trust me, nothing of the sort will taint this work.
---
## ISAAC:
I promise you on my life.
---
## ALICE:
Good.
---
## JOHN:
…Good.
---
## ISAAC:
I’ll leave you to consider this.
---
## ISAAC:
I do so hope you will join us, nay, complete us in this task.
---
## ISAAC:
Until, I hope, tomorrow.
---
## ISAAC:
And please ignore my father.
---
## ISAAC:
He’s blind, he’ll have no clue what we actually print anyway.
---
## ISAAC:
Good day, gentlemen. Miss.
---
## JOHN:
The answer to our prayers, perhaps.
---
## HENRY:
Does the devil answer prayers?
---
## ALICE:
Apparently he does.
---
## ALICE:
Though his son seems genuine enough to me.
---
## HENRY:
Aye, *seems*.
---
## HENRY:
Don’t come to me shocked when the devil’s son is exactly the devil’s like.
---
## JOHN:
Henry, this might be—nay, it surely is—our best chance to do this.
---
## JOHN:
Publish or vanish, wasn’t it?
---
## JOHN:
We are near certain of the latter if we refuse this.
---
## JOHN:
What say you, friend?
---
## CRIER:
Masters and Mistresses!
---
## CRIER:
The King’s Men present the tragical history of *Hamlet, Prince of Denmark*!
---
## CRIER:
Starting now at the Globe Theatre!
---
## CRIER:
Starting now!
---
## ELIZABETH:
Alice, dear.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Are you all right?
---
## ALICE:
I need to find my father, where’s my father?
---
## ELIZABETH:
He’s with Henry at a meeting.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Will you sit, you look—
---
## ALICE:
Of course, the meeting.
---
## ALICE:
I have to go—
---
## ELIZABETH:
Alice?
---
## ALICE:
I have to go.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Ali, Who’s hurt?
---
## BERNARDO:
Who’s there?
---
## FRANCISCO:
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
---
## BERNARDO:
Long live the king!
---
## FRANCISCO:
Bernardo?
---
## BERNARDO:
He.
---
## FRANCISCO:
You come most carefully upon your hour.
---
## JAGGARD:
Upon this hour, gentlemen, we begin a great thing together.
---
## JAGGARD:
Literature is set and opportunity is met.
---
## BERNARDO:
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
---
## BERNARDO:
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
---
## FRANCISCO:
I think I hear them.
---
## FRANCISCO:
Stand, ho! Who’s there?
---
## HORATIO:
Friends to this ground
---
## MARCELLUS:
And liegemen to the Dane.
---
## ISAAC:
Friends and partners, we must be both in this and we will make a great thing between us all.
---
## JAGGARD:
And a great return on our investment.
---
## ISAAC:
My father is blunt but honest.
---
## ISAAC:
Farewell.
---
## MARCELLUS:
O, farewell, honest soldier:
---
## MARCELLUS:
Who hath relieved you?
---
## MARCELLUS:
Bernardo hath my place.
---
## FRANCISCO:
Give you good night.
---
## ISAAC:
Good night, gentlemen, and may I again say that I will not fail you in this.
---
## JOHN:
Good night, son, and thank you.
---
## ISAAC:
Thank you for your trust in me.
---
## HENRY:
We have less trust in you than we have hope.
---
## JOHN:
And where hope springs, faith must appear.
---
## MARCELLUS:
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
---
## ISAAC:
Faith is better than nothing.
---
## BERNARDO:
I have seen nothing.
---
## MARCELLUS:
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him.
---
## HENRY:
I will not believe a one of them until I see it, John.
---
## HENRY:
Until I see that book in my hand.
---
## JOHN:
The boy is on our side, Henry.
---
## HENRY:
I still don’t know.
---
## HENRY:
Is this the right thing?
---
## HENRY:
I do not know.
---
## JOHN:
Yes, it is.
---
## JOHN:
Although it’s also the *only* thing.
---
## JOHN:
So we must make it right and keep it right.
---
## HENRY:
Then that’s what we’ll do.
---
## HENRY:
Starting tomorrow.
---
## JOHN:
…And tomorrow.
---
## HENRY:
……And tomorrow.
---
## ALICE: (breathless)
*DAD*! 
--
Dad…
---
---
## REBECCA:
Goodnight, John.
---
## REBECCA:
Go to bed.
---
## JOHN:
What, my dear?
---
## JOHN:
Are you all right?
---
## JOHN:
What do you need?
---
## REBECCA:
I need you to sleep.
---
## REBECCA:
That’s what people mean when they say “goodnight.”
---
## REBECCA:
You don’t have to stay next to me every moment.
---
## JOHN:
I’m not leaving you.
---
## REBECCA:
John.
---
## JOHN:
I’m not.
---
## REBECCA:
I’m fine.
---
## JOHN:
You’re not, and I’m not, so here I stay.
---
## REBECCA:
Then neither of us will sleep.
---
## REBECCA:
I can’t rest when I know you’re sitting right there worrying about me.
---
## REBECCA:
Don’t you have a book to worry you?
---
## JOHN:
Don’t think about that.
---
## JOHN:
I’m right here and I’m staying here until you can stand up and walk about and start giving me orders again.
---
## REBECCA:
I can give you orders from bed, thank you.
---
## REBECCA:
The book, John.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t care about the book.
---
## JOHN:
I’m not bothering with it.
---
## JOHN:
Not now.
---
## REBECCA:
Yes, you are.
---
## JOHN:
Not now.
---
## REBECCA:
Yes, now.
---
## REBECCA:
I need it now and so do you.
---
## REBECCA:
Your sons might have never seen you onstage, but I did.
---
## REBECCA:
And I’ve never seen you happier.
---
## REBECCA:
Or more full of life.
---
## REBECCA:
Or handsomer.
---
## REBECCA:
I know Will’s words made you, John.
---
## REBECCA:
Return the favor.
---
## JOHN:
Handsomer?
---
## REBECCA:
Always had a weakness for men in make-up.
---
## JOHN:
Well, you married a player and ended up with a manager.
---
## REBECCA:
I know whom I married.
---
## REBECCA:
In your heart, you’re a player still.
---
## REBECCA:
The heart’s what matters.
---
## JOHN:
When I thought you were gone my heart stopped.
---
## JOHN:
No play has sent me to my knees and then up again and through the streets running as last night.
---
## JOHN:
Nothing is worth more than you.
---
## REBECCA:
Then listen to me.
---
## REBECCA:
When the world grew dark, where did you turn?
---
## REBECCA:
When our sweet Mary died?
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
---
## REBECCA:
And then young John.
---
## REBECCA:
Then our Lizzie.
---
## JOHN:
God bless them.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t know how people go on after loss like that, but somehow they do.
---
## JOHN:
We did.
---
## REBECCA:
Every day is someone’s worst.
---
## REBECCA:
At least ours we had together.
---
## JOHN:
You bore it all so much better than I did.
---
## REBECCA:
No, I didn’t.
---
## REBECCA:
We all bear it as we can.
---
## REBECCA:
Most people would go to church, but you went to The Globe.
---
## JOHN:
No, I didn’t.
---
## REBECCA:
I know you went there.
---
## REBECCA:
Alone and at night.
---
## REBECCA:
Why?
---
## REBECCA:
What did you do there?
---
## REBECCA:
Meet Will?
---
## JOHN:
No.
---
## REBECCA:
Henry?
---
## JOHN:
No.
---
## JOHN:
I would…
--
just speak.
---
## JOHN:
It seems childish, but I would stand on the boards and speak.
---
## JOHN:
The whole theater dark, but for a candle to my side.
---
## JOHN:
I would recite speeches.
---
## JOHN:
*Hamlet* and *Lear*.
---
## JOHN:
Some *King John*, anything that would direct the rage…
---
## JOHN:
The pain, the endless pain of it.
---
## JOHN:
Plays held more solace than priests.
---
## JOHN:
They always did, in that respect.
---
## JOHN:
You’re supposed to be quiet in church.
---
## JOHN:
That I could not do.
---
## JOHN:
Not when God asked me to hold that much in my heart.
---
## JOHN:
I could not do that.
---
## REBECCA:
You needed words.
---
## JOHN:
Yes, I did.
---
## JOHN:
They were alive for me.
---
## REBECCA:
Yes, they are.
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
---
## REBECCA:
The book, John.
---
## JOHN:
The book.
---
## REBECCA:
When the world gets too dark.
---
## JOHN:
Too dark to bear.
---
## REBECCA:
The words, John.
---
## REBECCA:
There’s light in them.
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
---
## JOHN:
Light.
---
## REBECCA:
There’s life in them.
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
---
## JOHN:
Life.
---
## REBECCA:
Good night, John.
---
## JOHN:
Good night…
---
## REBECCA:
Good night…
---
## JOHN:
Sweet prince.
---
## REBECCA:
Dear John.
---
## JOHN:
And may flights of angels…
---
## REBECCA:
…sing thee to thy…
---
## JOHN:
…rest.
---
## HENRY:
John…
--
John, it’s midnight, you shouldn’t be here.
---
## JOHN:
What?
---
## HENRY:
I said you shouldn’t be here.
---
## HENRY:
Come with me…
--
come home.
---
## JOHN:
There is no home without her.
---
## JOHN:
There is nowhere to go.
---
## HENRY:
I know it feels that way.
---
## HENRY:
I know it does.
---
## HENRY:
But you can come with me.
---
## JOHN:
Why?
---
## HENRY:
Because this is the hardest thing you’ll ever go through, 
---
## HENRY:
and I won’t have you go through it alone.
---
## HENRY:
Elizabeth insists you come and eat with us.
---
## HENRY:
Come and eat.
---
## JOHN:
I have never thought food as useless as I do now.
---
---
## HENRY:
Then we’ll both starve.
---
## HENRY:
On stage…
--
in the dark.
---
## HENRY:
When my first boy died, only months old, 
---
## HENRY:
I couldn’t imagine a loving God that would have any part in such a thing.
---
## HENRY:
And I told him so in my prayers…
--
silent…
---
## HENRY:
Because I know I’d be the one in the ground if anyone heard 
---
## HENRY:
what I thought of God and his taking and taking and taking.
---
## HENRY:
Then I realized the great weight of every grieving father’s prayers
---
## HENRY:
that must hit God every night and must sound so much like my own.
---
## HENRY:
Sons who lost fathers…
---
## HENRY:
Husbands without wives…
---
## HENRY:
Mothers…
--
oh God, the mothers…
---
## HENRY:
All that grief on God’s ear constantly.
---
## HENRY:
Then I felt *bad* for God.
---
## HENRY:
Which made me laugh…
---
## HENRY:
…which made me feel alive again.
---
## HENRY:
Funny how that worked out, didn’t it?
---
## JOHN:
That’s a good story.
---
## JOHN:
Why do we bother?
---
## HENRY:
With what?
---
## JOHN:
With stories.
---
## JOHN:
Dramas…
--
especially the dramas.
---
## JOHN:
Isn’t that ridiculous?
---
## JOHN:
Grown men dressing up as kings, 
--
and, even more ridiculously, 
--
queens.
---
## JOHN:
And the people come to see it.
---
## JOHN:
And they laugh.
---
## JOHN:
But they also weep.
---
## JOHN:
They weep with us.
---
## JOHN:
Why do they do it?
---
## HENRY:
Because stories are real in their own way.
---
## JOHN:
No…
--
real life keeps going on and on.
---
## JOHN:
And the villains aren’t caught, and the endings aren’t right…
---
## JOHN:
And it’s rough seas and dark days…
---
## JOHN:
And we sit here in this barn playing fictions for willing dreamers.
---
## JOHN:
We tell it over and over and over again.
---
## JOHN:
And I sit through it…
---
## JOHN:
And it’s false and it’s hot air…
--
and I need it.
---
## JOHN:
When I have nothing left to say…
--
I need it.
---
## JOHN:
When I hurt so much I can’t breathe…
---
## JOHN:
When I’ve got a horse for a heart and it won’t stop running and pounding and running me down…
---
## JOHN:
I need it.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t even want it, but I…
---
## HENRY:
John—
---
## JOHN:
Am I godless?
---
## JOHN:
I look to fairies and false kings instead of holy people.
---
## JOHN:
Does that a heathen make?
---
## HENRY:
No…
--
of course not, no.
---
## JOHN:
I cannot breathe without her.
---
## JOHN:
I cannot breathe at home, or in the street, or in the yard where she now lies.
---
## JOHN:
I cannot breathe in this world…
---
## JOHN:
But here…
--
here I am come.
---
## JOHN:
And I am lulled into meaning.
---
## JOHN:
And that is greatest fiction of all.
---
## JOHN:
Meaning anything.
---
## JOHN:
*And God and his angels mock us every ending we play but the tragic ones…*
---
## JOHN:
*For if they aren’t tragedies yet, they will soon enough be.*
---
## JOHN:
Story’s a forged life.
---
## JOHN:
Life’s a tempest of loss.
---
## JOHN:
Why do we bother with any of it?
---
## HENRY:
To feel again.
---
## JOHN:
I feel enough.
---
## HENRY:
I said to feel *again*.
---
## HENRY:
That’s the miracle of it.
---
## HENRY:
The fairies aren’t real, but the feeling is.
---
## HENRY:
And it comes to us here, player and groundling alike.
---
## HENRY:
Again and again…here.
---
## HENRY:
Your favorite story just ended?
---
## HENRY:
Come back tomorrow, we’ll play it again.
---
## HENRY:
Don’t like the story you’re in?
---
## HENRY:
A different one starts in an hour.
---
## HENRY:
Come here…
--
come again…
--
feel here…
--
feel again.
---
## HENRY:
History walks here, love is lived here.
---
## HENRY:
Loss is met and wept for and understood and survived here.
---
## HENRY:
And not the first time, but every time.
---
## HENRY:
We play love’s first look and life’s last—here—every day.
---
## HENRY:
And you will see yourself in it, or your fear, or your future, before the play’s end.
---
## HENRY:
And you will test your heart against trouble and joy.
---
## HENRY:
And every time, you’ll feel a flicker or a fountain of feeling that reminds you
---
## HENRY:
that, yes, you are yet living.
---
## HENRY:
And that is more than God gives you in his ample silence.
---
## HENRY:
And then it ends.
---
## HENRY:
And we players stand up.
---
## HENRY:
And we look at the gathered crowd.
---
## HENRY:
And we bow.
---
## HENRY:
Because the story was told well enough, and it’s time for another.

## HENRY:
Mourn her, honor her, but do not join her yet.
---
## JOHN:
She spoke to me.
---
## JOHN:
About the book.
---
## JOHN:
She insists.
---
## HENRY:
Well…
--
she was always wiser than you were.
---
## JOHN:
Ali.
---
## JOHN:
What are you doing here, what brings you?
---
## ALICE:
I don’t know.
---
## ALICE:
I couldn’t think of anywhere else to be…

## FRUIT MERCHANT:
Apples! Pears! Figs and nuts!
---
## FRUIT MERCHANT:
All the freshest! Apples, pears, figs and nuts!
---
## CRANE:
Again, anything that is not the closest to Will’s mind and hand, we do not include.
---
## CRANE:
If it is suspect, we don’t include it.
---
## CRANE:
If it is written in too much collaboration, we do not include it.
---
## ISAAC:
So, we lose *Two Noble Kinsman*?
---
## HENRY:
With Fletcher? 
--
Yes.
---
## ISAAC:
And *Cardenio*?
---
## CRANE:
Not a chance.
---
## ISAAC:
Well, what about *Love’s Labors Won*?
---
## CRANE:
It’s lost.
---
## ISAAC:
I know that, but we have *Love’s Labors Lost*, where’s *Love’s Labors Won*?
---
## CRANE:
I’m saying it’s *lost*.
---
## ISAAC:
I know, but he also wrote *Won*.
---
## CRANE:
*Which is lost*.
---
## ISAAC:
There are two plays, man!
---
## CRANE:
And one of them is gone—we can’t find it—
---
## CRANE:
*Won* is lost.
---
## CRANE:
All we have is *Lost* because we lost *Won*, all right?
---
## ISAAC:
All right.
---
## HENRY:
*All right.*
---
## HENRY:
Now what about *The Hairy Wives of Windsor*?
---
## HENRY:
I’m kidding, Crane. Joke, *joke*.
---
## ELIZABETH:
I apologize for everything about him.
---
## CRANE:
This is of utmost importance to me.
---
## CRANE:
He was a great man, Will, and a great friend to me, 
---
## CRANE:
and I feel it’s my duty to care for his legacy like it were my own,
---
## CRANE:
and I do not see any humor in editing.
---
## JOHN:
I don’t either, Crane…
---
## JOHN:
I’ve always said there’s nothing to laugh about in the theatre.
---
## HENRY:
John, come in. Come sit.
---
## JOHN:
Hello friends…carry on.
---
## CRANE:
Sir, welcome back.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Darling John.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Ali, how are you?
---
## ALICE:
Better, thank you.
---
## JOHN:
And ready to work.
---
## JOHN:
If you are.
---
## ISAAC:
Indeed we are, sir.
---
## ISAAC:
And I am so sorry for you.
---
## ALICE:
Thank you.
---
## ALICE:
Being here feels right.
---
## ALICE:
Mum loved this effort like she loved the plays themselves.
---
## ALICE:
Well, like she loved…
--
the comedies.
---
## JOHN:
Shall we?
---
## HENRY:
We shall.
---
## HENRY:
We start editing the *un*published plays,
---
## HENRY:
 of which we’ve got five copies from Master Crane in his fine hand.
---
## ISAAC:
Yes, sir.
---
## ISAAC:
*Two Gents*, *Merry Wives*, *Measure for Measure*, *Winter’s Tale*, *The Tempest*.
---
## CRANE:
Also I can vouch for these copies of *Caesar*, *As You Like It*, *Macbeth*, and *Cymbeline*.
---
## HENRY:
We all know these nine are true and good as we have watched and performed them ourselves.
---
## JOHN:
Good. 
--
Next.
---
## CRANE:
Next are the foul papers, first drafts.
---
## ALICE:
First drafts?!
---
## CRANE:
These escaped the fire under my arm.
---
## HENRY:
And thank god they did.
---
## HENRY:
Will’s papers plus our memory can give us a fair version of these.
---
## CRANE:
*Comedy of Errors*, *Taming of the Shrew*, *All’s Well,*, *Antony*, *Coriolanus*, *Timon* and *Henry VIII*.
---
## CRANE:
That’s sixteen.
---
## HENRY:
*Henry VI*…
--
we have Will’s own manuscript.
---
## ELIZABETH:
The man gets a say at last.
---
## CRANE:
For *King John* we have a promptbook.
---
## CRANE:
And that makes eighteen.
---
## CRANE:
The rest of the folio will come from the published plays that we have in quarto, good and bad.
---
## HENRY:
Do not trust the quartos as most of them are not sanctioned by the King’s Men.
---
## ELIZABETH:
The best quarto we have is *Much Ado*.
---
## CRANE:
It’s nearly perfect, won’t take time at all to set it.
---
## ELIZABETH:
*Romeo and Juliet* and *Love’s Labour’s* are mostly intact.
---
## ALICE:
*Midsummer*’s not bad…
--
but use the second quarto, not the first.
---
## ALICE:
Not that anyone likes *Midsummer,* anyway.
---
## ISAAC:
Oh, I do.
---
## ISAAC:
I love a love story.
---
---
## CRANE:
Now for *Merchant,* we’ll use the first quarto not the second,
---
## CRANE:
and I think the latest quarto of *Richard II* is the best if we use the promptbook for the abdication scene.
---
## HENRY:
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN:
Agreed.
---
## CRANE:
Good.
---
## CRANE:
Now…
--
*Hamlet*.
---
## ISAAC:
*Hamlet*’s first quarto is a mess, but the second’s not bad.
---
## ELIZABETH:
And we have promptbooks and sides for *Hamlet*.
---
## ALICE:
We all know that one so well, we’ll be fine on it.
---
## HENRY:
But *Lear* needs work.
---

## ALICE: 
Careful!

---
## HENRY:
Sorry! Sorry!
---
## CRANE:
Now it needs *lots* of work.
---
## HENRY:
I said I’m sorry.
---
## ISAAC:
*Titus* needs work…*Othello* is good…
---
## ISAAC:
*Troilus* is done from Walley’s copy…just some minor fixes.
---
## CRANE:
It’s the other *Henrys* that are going to take time.
---
## CRANE:
I’ll fix it, but some idiot added heaps of low speech throughout.
---
## JOHN:
You focus on those, Crane.
---
## JOHN:
Condi and I will start going through the plays in the order we’ve laid them out for publishing.
---
## JOHN:
Comedies first.
---
## HENRY:
Remember, we aim to be careful and correct, not quick.
---
## ISAAC:
Perhaps a touch quick.
---
## ISAAC:
As soon as you finalize the plays, my men will set the type, start printing…
---
## ISAAC:
And we will have our book in a year or so.
---
## HENRY:
All right, let’s not take a decade.
---
## HENRY:
I’d certainly like to live to see the damn thing done.
---
## HENRY:
Are we agreed?
---
template: noise
(everyone agrees)
---
## HENRY:
Wait.
---
## HENRY:
Did we mention *Pericles*? 
--
Where’s *Pericles*?
---
## CRANE:
It’s…
--
out.
---
## HENRY:
WHAT?
---
## ELIZABETH:
Henry…
---
## HENRY:
WHAT?
---
## CRANE:
Its origins are dubious, Master Condell.
---
## CRANE:
I’m sorry, it’s out.
---
## HENRY:
John!
---
## CRANE:
*You heard me.*
---
## JOHN:
Henry, look, we’ll have Crane pen a special copy of the play just for you, all right?
---
## CRANE:
We’ll have Crane do *what*?
---
## JOHN:
*…All right?*
---
## CRANE:
Fine.
---
## HENRY: (grudgingly)
*All right.* 
--
But use the good ink. 
--
There’s a future in that one.
---
## ELIZABETH:
Everyone please.
---
## ELIZABETH:
We are all of us here grateful for all of us here.
---
## ELIZABETH:
And for all those not, we do this for them.
---
## ALICE:
Aye.
---
## JOHN:
That we do.
---
## JOHN:
Fourteen comedies.
---
## JOHN:
Ten histories.
---
## JOHN:
Eleven tragedies.
---
## JOHN:
And thank you.
---
---
## JOHN:
Look at that.
---
## HENRY:
There it is…
--
there it is, John.
---
## JOHN:
*Romeo and Juliet*.
---
## HENRY:
“Enter Sampson and Gregory, with Swords and Bucklers, of the House of Capulet.”
---
## JOHN:
Just look at it. Beautiful.
---
## JOHN:
Clean and clear and…
---
## JOHN:
Why is the word 
--
“go” 
--
spelled differently page to page?
---
## HENRY:
Is it? I’ll talk to them.
---
## HENRY:
“Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?”
---
## JOHN:
“I do bite my thumb, sir.”
---
## HENRY:
“Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
---
## MARCUS:
Do not touch the pages.
---
## MARCUS:
No one touches my pages.
---
## HENRY:
We were just looking, friend.
---
## MARCUS:
Looking leads to touching.
---
## MARCUS:
No touching.
---
## JOHN:
They’re our pages, young man.
---
## MARCUS:
Your pages?
---
## HENRY:
Yes, this is our book…
--
ours.
---
## MARCUS:
’Cause I thought you were dead.
---
## HENRY:
No, we’re not *him*.
---
## JOHN:
We’re not William Shakespeare.
---
## MARCUS:
Yeah ’cause he’s dead.
---
## HENRY:
We are well aware, we’re his friends.
---
## HENRY:
We’re the ones who started the entire effort.
---
## MARCUS:
All right, all right, no need to yell about it.
---
## MARCUS:
If you were Master Shakespeare, I’d have a thing or two to tell you.
---
## JOHN:
Really?
---
## MARCUS:
The end of—
--
what’s that one—
--
*Lear*?
---
## MARCUS:
Yeah…?
---
## MARCUS:
Could’ve worked on that one.
---
## HENRY:
…Excuse me?
---
## MARCUS:
Just saying.
---
## MARCUS:
Little dark, don’t you think?
---
## JOHN:
…It’s a tragedy.
---
## MARCUS:
He could’ve added a dance or something.
---
## HENRY:
And what is your exact function in this outfit?
---
## JAGGARD:
This is Marcus.
---
## JAGGARD:
Head compositor and general annoyance to all.
---
## MARCUS:
All right, all right.
---
## ISAAC:
He’s actually quite good at his job.
---
## HENRY:
Then he can fix the spelling.
---
## HENRY:
It’s different every page.
---
## MARCUS:
Everyone’s a critic.
---
## JAGGARD:
Would you desist?
---
## MARCUS:
All right, all right.
---
## ISAAC:
Now, we wouldn’t have bothered you if was it wasn’t urgent.
---
## JOHN:
What’s urgent? What’s wrong?

--
## HENRY:
What did you do now?
---
## JAGGARD:
No good to run around it…
<br>
--
The project’s off.
---
## ISAAC: (correcting)
The project’s on *hold*.
---
## HENRY:
What?

--
## JOHN:
On hold?
---
## HENRY:
What does that mean?
---
## JAGGARD:
It’s too expensive to publish it as is.
---
## HENRY:
You set the budget, Jaggard!
---
## JAGGARD:
And you insisted on the fine paper…
--
you insisted on folio…
---
## JAGGARD:
You insisted on the extra editors.
---
## JOHN:
Crane is the most knowledgeable one of us all about this.
---
## JAGGARD:
And he’s another mouth to feed.
---
## JAGGARD:
I’m sorry.
---
## HENRY:
No, you’re not, you’re cheap.
---
## ISAAC:
We’ll give you back your money.
---
## JAGGARD:
No, we won’t.
---
## JOHN:
We don’t want money, we want a book.
---
## ISAAC:
As do I.
---
## JAGGARD:
Boys, at this point the paper is worth more blank than it’s worth in verse.
---
## HENRY:
So you’re stopping mid-run?
---
## ISAAC:
Just pausing…
--
If we can get more money, we can start again.
---
## JOHN:
Isaac, come on, I’m looking at half of *Romeo and Juliet* just hanging here.
---
## HENRY:
I knew we should have never let this man near us.
---
## ISAAC:
Gentlemen, please, we just need a little bit more money.
---
## ISAAC:
More interest in the publication wouldn’t hurt either.
---
## JOHN:
If we can find the money, can we start printing immediately?
---
## ISAAC:
Yes.
---
## JAGGARD:
Well, we’ll have to see—
---
## ISAAC: (interrupting)
*Yes*—we will.
---
## ISAAC:
We’ll invest more ourselves.
---
## JAGGARD:
Like hell we will.
---
## HENRY:
We’ll find the money.
---
## HENRY:
…Will would hate it, but I know who to go to.
---
## JOHN:
Not Ben?
---
## HENRY:
Not Ben. 
--
Actually, Ben’s a great idea.
---
## ISAAC:
Ben Jonson?
---
## JOHN:
Ben spent all his money on beer and bail.
---
## HENRY:
Yes, but he’s got clout.
---
## HENRY:
He’s the Poet Laureate.
---
## HENRY:
If he’d come out in support of this book—
---
## HENRY:
—the book by his rival—
---
## HENRY:
People would start talking.
---
## JAGGARD:
That usually helps them start buying.
---
## HENRY:
He owes Will. He’ll do this.
---
## HENRY:
You talk to Ben.
---
## HENRY:
Get him to write something, a few lines.
---
## JOHN:
Why do I have to talk to Ben?
---
## JOHN:
Where are you going?
---
## HENRY:
To the Dark Lady.
---
## MARCUS:
Ooh, The Dark Lady?
---
## MARCUS:
Is that a play? I’d see that one. 
--
All right, all right.

Ben, it’s John. John Heminges.

I can see that, John Heminges…
--
what the hell are you doing at my door?
---
## JOHN:
Well, I’m here for Will…
--
Shakespeare.
---
## JOHN:
He needs you.
---
## BEN:
You know he’d deck you for saying that…

from the grave.

## BEN:
Come in.

## EMILIA: (laughing)
Henry Condell!
---
## EMILIA:
When she said it was you, I thought my maid had gone syphilitic.
---
## EMILIA:
How is your wife, your children?
---
## EMILIA:
Are you well?
---
## EMILIA:
I heard about Burbage, dear brute.
---
## EMILIA:
His Antony, I still remember.
---
## EMILIA:
Do sit, don’t stand. 
--
Wine? 
--
I will.
---
## HENRY:
Yes, Lady Lanier, and I thank you for seeing me.
---
## EMILIA:
Emilia! Emilia! We’re friends. 
---
## EMILIA:
—We were—in a different life perhaps, but still.
---
## EMILIA:
Why are you here, Henry?
---
## HENRY:
We need your help.
---
## EMILIA:
Oh…who is we?
---
## HENRY:
John and I. 
--
And Will.
---
## EMILIA:
Will?
---
## HENRY:
Shakespeare.
---
## EMILIA:
Well…
--
now I’m terribly interested, indeed.
---
## BEN:
And what does William Shakespeare require 
---
## BEN:
that God does not provide in Heaven?
---
## BEN:
And if he is not in Heaven, 
---
## BEN:
then tell him to wait until I get to Hell to bother me.
---
## JOHN:
We don’t want to bother you, Ben, but we do come to ask you something very important.
---
## BEN:
Then hurry up and ask.
---
## JOHN:
We’re in a pickle publishing Will’s plays and we wondered—
---
## BEN:
Who’s publishing?
---
## BEN:
Who’d you get to do it?
---
## JOHN:
Well… Jaggard.
---
## BEN:
Jaggard? You let Jaggard have it?
---
## BEN:
After burning my favor owed from the Lord Chamberlain?
---
## JOHN:
I know, we had no choice.
---
## BEN:
The only choice I see 
--
is to poison his soup.
---
## JOHN:
We don’t want you to poison anyone, we want you to…
--
preface the book.
---
## BEN:
Preface the book?
---
## HENRY:
If he were alive he’d never allow us to bother you, but…
---
## HENRY:
Well, however he broke your heart, I hope that the love you showed him once will bare itself again in this hour of need.
---
## EMILIA:
My heart?
---
## EMILIA:
Is that what he said?
---
## EMILIA:
Of course he did.
---
## EMILIA:
The things men say away from women are never to be trusted.
---
## HENRY:
Do I offend you, milady?
---
## EMILIA:
Oh no, no.
---
## EMILIA:
Though it was most certainly *his* heart that broke.
---
## EMILIA:
He was not the kind of man who could keep a friend after being a certain kind of friendly.
---
## HENRY:
You broke his heart?
---
## EMILIA:
Oh yes, terribly.
---
## EMILIA:
All those sonnets don’t come from happy endings.
---
## HENRY:
I know it didn’t end well between you two, but—
---
## EMILIA:
“For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,”
---
## EMILIA:
“Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.”
---
## EMILIA:
Thank you, Will, thank you so much.
---
## JOHN:
Your support—kind words from the Poet Laureate…
---
## JOHN:
It would go a long way to legitimize the effort.
---
## BEN:
He did lack a certain legitimacy, didn’t he? 
--
The *groundling* pleaser.
---
## BEN:
Not every play needs a goddamn clown.
---
## JOHN:
Yes, well—
---
## BEN:
It was the love stories I couldn’t stand.
---
## BEN:
When I go to the theater, I’d like to engage in a thought or two,
---
## BEN:
not suffer the kissing bits without gagging.
---
## JOHN:
Well, you needn’t mention the love stories, then—
---
## BEN:
And fucking *Pericles*.
---
## BEN:
God…
--
what horseshit.
---
## JOHN:
Let’s keep that between us, shall we?
---
## HENRY:
You were a kind of a muse to him.
---
## HENRY:
He wanted to write you into every play.
---
## EMILIA:
He managed to get me in a few, I recall.
---
## HENRY:
You were the heart of his Beatrice…Rosalind…Lady Macbeth.
---
## EMILIA:
Lady M?
---
## HENRY:
Ironically, the happiest couple he ever wrote.
---
## HENRY:
And even in *Othello,* he used your name for Emilia.
---
## EMILIA:
Yes, well the man failed to realize that most successful courtships 
---
## EMILIA:
don’t include naming a character after your true love
---
## EMILIA:
and then *stabbing* her to death in the end.
---
## HENRY:
He did read your book of poems.
---
## HENRY:
He liked it…
--
loved it.
---
## EMILIA:
Did he?
---
## HENRY:
Oh yes, very much.
---
## HENRY:
Though I think it made him cringe from curiosity…
---
## HENRY:
The pain in wondering where your lost loves are now.
---
## EMILIA:
I did love him.
---
## EMILIA:
Which was the problem.
---
## EMILIA:
Love is not a light thing for a poet.
---
## JOHN:
If you could manage only a few lines—
---
## JOHN:
They needn’t be praise, just remembrance, a somber something, whatever you like.
---
## BEN:
Hmm.
---
## JOHN:
Or…
--
yes.
---
## JOHN:
Perhaps we do a greater disservice giving his rival the first word in his life’s work—
---
## BEN:
I’ll do it.
---
## JOHN:
No, you’re right—
---
## BEN:
I’ll do it.
---
## JOHN:
It’s a stupid idea—
---
## BEN:
*I said I’ll do it.*
---
## BEN:
Something short. 
--
Pedestrian.
---
## BEN:
Something *his* audience could understand.
---
## BEN:
Give me a week.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you, Ben.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you so much.
---
## BEN: (softly)
Oh…
--
John…
--
I heard about your wife.
---
## BEN: (softly)
Terrible thing that.
---
## BEN: (softly)
I liked her very much.
---
## JOHN:
I know.
---
## BEN:
I don’t like many people.
---
## JOHN:
I know.
---
## EMILIA:
All right Henry, you fanned my flame long enough.
---
## EMILIA:
How can I help you?
---
## HENRY:
We need money to finish publishing Will’s collected works.
---
## EMILIA:
A collection?
---
## HENRY:
Yes, which is quite the task and we’ve hit a ditch and we didn’t want to ask you but…
---
## EMILIA:
I suppose…
--
penance for breaking a poet’s heart is living with its output.
---
## EMILIA:
I am happy to help.
---
## HENRY:
We thank you, milady.
---
## EMILIA:
I do miss him.
---
## EMILIA:
I hope he knew that.
---
## EMILIA:
God, he was good.
---
## EMILIA:
And his plays weren’t bad, either.
---
## HENRY:
Oh, my word.
---
## EMILIA:
Do I make you blush?
---
## HENRY:
I was his best friend.
---
## HENRY:
You do not tell me anything I have not already heard in reverse.
---
## BEN:
Wait now.
---
## BEN:
Jaggard’s the only one who—
---
## BEN:
Are you publishing this thing in folio?
---
## BEN:
I printed my collection in folio years ago and—
---
## BEN:
I swear that man aggravates me from the grave.
---
## JOHN:
I’ll be back in a week.
---
## BEN:
Bloody Will Bloody Shakespeare.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you, Ben.
---
## JOHN:
You’re a good man.
---
## BEN:
Just leave, 
--
I’ve got beer to do, get out.
---
## JOHN:
I think you mean work.
---
## BEN:
I know what I mean, get out.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you, Ben.

I dunno.

Yeah is that…

is that him?

## MARCUS:
Doesn’t quite look like it, does it?

## COMPOSITOR:
I only met him twice but—

## MARCUS:
I saw him onstage a dozen times.
---
## MARCUS:
In costume I’ll warrant, but…
---
## COMPOSITOR:
That’s it! It’s the ruff.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Not sure about the ruff.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Trying to make him look kingly, I suppose.
---

I think it makes his head look

like a ham on a platter.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
That’s what it is. 
--
A touch decapitational.
---
## MARCUS:
Floats there, eyeing you like a frog on a rock.

## COMPOSITOR:
Why do they need a picture of him, anyway?
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Makes me nervous him looking at me while I’m trying to read.
---
## MARCUS:
Those two friends of his commissioned it special.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Well, I never heard of a book with a picture of the author in it.

## COMPOSITOR:
Seems to be beside the point.
---
## MARCUS:
Though they won’t admit it, I find writers tend to like being noticed.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Even the dead ones?
---
## MARCUS:
Especially them.
---
## JAGGARD:
*Goddammit! Blasted! Shite!*
---
## ISAAC:
Stop the presses! Stop them all!
---
## MARCUS:
What’s wrong now?
---
## JAGGARD:
*Goddamn! Horsey fucker!*
---
## ISAAC:
I *said* stop working.
---
## MARCUS:
All right, all right.
---
## ISAAC:
How much have you done of *Romeo and Juliet*?
---
## MARCUS:
Most all of it.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
But you told us to finish the histories before going back to the lovey ones.
---
## MARCUS:
We’re still ending with *Cymbeline* though, right?
---
## ISAAC:
Yes, that’s not at issue.
---
## MARCUS:
I do love that bit with the eagle.
---
## MARCUS:
Now that’s how you end a play.
---
## ISAAC:
Marcus. Have you printed *Troilus*?
---
## ISAAC:
The order was *Romeo and Juliet* and then *Troilus*.
---
## ISAAC:
Have you started *Troilus*?
---
## MARCUS:
Only a bit of it.
---
## MARCUS:
The last page of *Romeo* and the first three of *Troilus* share a sheet.
---
## ISAAC:
Now they don’t.
---
## JAGGARD:
*Fuckers*.
---
## MARCUS:
Well, we’ve already printed ten of ‘em.
---
## ISAAC:
Cross them out.
---
## MARCUS:
Cross them—?
---
## ISAAC:
*Troilus* is pulled.
---
## ISAAC:
Cross it out on the ones already printed, we can’t waste the paper.
---
## JAGGARD:
This is not my fault.
---
## JAGGARD:
Walley is a shite man.
---
## ISAAC:
You told me you had all the rights for all the plays!
---
## JAGGARD:
You never have *all* the rights.
---
## JAGGARD:
You *get* the rights.
---
## JAGGARD:
That’s the fun of it.
---
## ISAAC:
You start printing things you don’t own.
---
## ISAAC:
This is why everyone in this business hates you.
---
## JAGGARD:
This is why everyone in this business knows who I am.
---
## JAGGARD:
I’ll fix this.
---
## ISAAC:
You can’t.
---
## ISAAC:
Walley said no.
---
## ISAAC:
In fact he said, 
---
## ISAAC:
“No, you lowly rat, never in ten hells would I give it to you”
---
## JAGGARD:
Just caught him on a bad day.
---
## ISAAC:
You were trying to play him and it failed.
---
## ISAAC:
This time, the one time we’re working on something I care about, 
---
## ISAAC:
you are caught in your deceptions.
---
## ISAAC:
Now we have *The Collected Works of William Shakespeare Except For That One Play We Lost Because The Publisher is A Cad*.
---
## JAGGARD:
I *said* I will fix this.
---
## JAGGARD:
Walley has friends.
---
## ISAAC:
Have you ever wondered what that must be like?
---
## JAGGARD:
He has friends who owe me.
---
## JAGGARD:
Let me fix this the way I know how.
---
## ISAAC:
We are not putting anything but Shakespeare in this.
---
## ISAAC:
Do not for a moment think—
---
## JAGGARD:
I’m not.
---
## ISAAC:
Do not for a moment think of shoving some crap sonnets by some crap hacks in this book.
---
## JAGGARD:
I’ve published more books that you’ve ever seen in your life.
---
## JAGGARD:
There’s always something that goes wrong, just let me handle it.
---
## ISAAC:
That’s why we’re in this mess!
---
## JAGGARD:
Trust me.
---
## JAGGARD:
The rest of the work is set and printed?
---
## MARCUS:
All but the Greeky one.
---
## JAGGARD:
Good.
---
## JAGGARD:
Get John and Henry to write something for the front.
---
## ISAAC:
What for the front?
---
## JAGGARD:
Some introduction.
---
## JAGGARD:
“We knew him, we loved him,” whatever.
---
## JAGGARD:
Make it sound like love, not profit.
---
## ISAAC:
That’s what it always has been.
---
## JAGGARD:
Then they should have no problem penning it in a hurry.
---
## JAGGARD:
Actually do have them put something in there about buying it.
---
## JAGGARD:
“Buy the book you’re reading don’t just read it,” … something.
---
## JAGGARD:
Then set the title page, roll the engraving, and there you have it.
---
## JAGGARD:
Fourteen comedies, ten histories, 
---
## JAGGARD:
and somewhere between ten and eleven tragedies by the great playwright,
---
## JAGGARD:
published according to the True Original Copies, Printed 1623 by…
---
## JAGGARD:
Isaac Jaggard.
---
## ISAAC:
…What?
---
## JAGGARD:
This is your book, son.
---
## JAGGARD:
The world should know it.
---
## MARCUS:
What about *Timon of Athens*?
---
## ISAAC:
What?
---
## MARCUS:
We could put *Timon of Athens* instead of *Troilus*.
---
## MARCUS:
I like *Troilus* better but both have their problems,
---
## MARCUS:
and, you know, *Timon* is kinda Greeky too.
---
## JAGGARD:
I can get *Troilus* back.
---
## ISAAC:
Switch the plates to *Timon of Athens*, reset the contents page, and prep the picture.
---
## MARCUS:
About the picture.
---
## COMPOSITOR:
We’d suggest a bit more shading on the ruff.
---
## MARCUS:
Make him look less like dinner.
---
## ISAAC:
Like what? 
--
…Oh god, tell him to fix it.
---
## MARCUS:
Yes sir.
---
## ISAAC:
Not you, you’ve got to work.
---
## MARCUS:
Yes sir.
---
## JAGGARD:
Isaac, wait.
---
## ISAAC:
I’ll do it.
---
## JAGGARD:
Son.
---
## ISAAC:
I have this under control now.
---
## ISAAC:
And when this shop is mine, I will not run it like you.
---
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Do you need some help, sir?
---
## COMPOSITOR:
Point you in the right direction?
---
## JAGGARD:
Somehow, I always know the right direction.
---
---
## HENRY:
What? Alice…
--
is it bad?
---
## HENRY:
I knew it. 
--
*I knew it.*
---
## JOHN:
Let her read it, Henry.
---
## HENRY:
She’s been reading it for ten minutes.
---
## HENRY:
What’s wrong with it?
---
## ALICE:
Nothing’s wrong with it, I’m reading it carefully.
---
## JOHN:
She’s reading it carefully.
---
## HENRY:
I didn’t think we’d have to write something.
---
## HENRY:
That’s kind of the point of all this.
---
## HENRY:
I speak the speech.
---
## JOHN:
And I pay for it.
---
## JOHN:
And neither of us should be let near a quill.
---
## ALICE:
“It had been a thing, we confess, worthy to have been wished,”
---
## ALICE:
“that the author himself had lived to have set forth, and overseen his own writings;”
---
## ALICE:
“but since it hath been ordained otherwise, and he by death departed from that right,”
---
## ALICE:
“we pray you do not envy his friends, the office of  their care, and pain, to have collected and published them.”
---
## ALICE:
It’s good.
---
## HENRY:
Is it really?
---
## JOHN:
Honestly…Ali.
---
## JOHN:
We need your honest eyes on this.
---
## ALICE:
The beginning is a bit pecuniary.
---
## ALICE:
“Buy it first.”
---
## ALICE:
“That doth best commend a book.”
---
## JOHN:
Well, if it doesn’t sell—
---
## HENRY:
Jaggard insisted we put it in.
---
## ALICE:
The best bit is at the end.
---
## ALICE:
“Who, as he was a happy imitator of  nature, was a most gentle expresser of it.”
---
## ALICE:
“His mind and hand went together”.
---
## ALICE:
It’s very good.
---
## ALICE:
Will would have loved it.
---
## ALICE:
Mum, too.
---
## BEN:
I cannot take it.
---
## BEN:
I cannot and will not.
---
## BEN:
I cannot do it, men.
---
## ALICE:
What’s wrong with you, Ben?
---
## HENRY:
Are you well, man?
---
## HENRY:
You look not so.
---
## BEN:
Do grown men weep in public if they be well?
---
## ALICE:
We’ll get you a drink.
---
## BEN:
I have been drunk for three days straight—

--
## ALICE:
No drink then.
---
## BEN:
—and without drink I will not last a fourth.

--
## ALICE:
Coming right up.
---
## HENRY:
Pity’s sake, tell us what ills you, Ben.
---
## BEN:
…William. 
--
Bloody. 
--
Shakespeare.
---
## BEN:
God help me, here I go again.
---
## JOHN:
Ben, sit…
--
what on earth…?
---
## BEN:
I started your lines, some tepid praise…
---
## BEN:
Some “good man, 
--
good words, 
--
hey nonny nonny.”
---
## BEN:
Then I said, let me read a play or two to remind myself.
---
## BEN:
I set out at midnight, dragged Crane from bed.
---
## BEN:
“Show me Shakespeare!”
---
## BEN:
And I read everything.
---
## BEN:
That man.
---
## BEN:
*Hamlet*…
--
*Lear*…
--
*Romeo and What’s-Her-Name*.
---
## ALICE:
You read them all.
---
## HENRY:
And at once?
---
## JOHN:
That’d be too much for anyone.
---
## BEN:
I’d only ever *heard* the plays, *seen* them,
---
## BEN:
never been alone with them.
---
## BEN:
And there I was.
---
## BEN:
And there they were, these pinnacles of story, these peaks of heart.
---
## BEN:
The way he grows in the writing, too.
---
## BEN:
As a man himself.
---
## BEN:
But even young, the wisdom he put down.
---
## BEN:
How did he know those things so young?
---
## BEN:
How could he?
---
## BEN:
God help me.
---
## BEN:
I started drinking and haven’t stopped since.
---
## JOHN:
Oh dear.
---
## ALICE:
Perhaps some food instead of ale.
---
## HENRY:
I know the feeling you’re in, Ben.
---
## HENRY:
I do and I respect it.
---
## HENRY:
But I need to ask if you penned the lines yet?
---
## BEN:
What?
---
## HENRY:
The printing’s almost done and we just need those few lines to say you knew him.
---
## BEN:
Of course I knew him.
---
## BEN:
I was with him the day before he…
--
he died.
---
## BEN:
I was there and I could’ve…
---
## JOHN:
Ben, no, it’s not your fault.
---
## BEN:
What if it was, I could have stopped him.
---
## JOHN:
You couldn’t have.
---
## ALICE:
It was a fever.
---
## ALICE:
What’s to be done?
---
## BEN:
He was drinking with me, he was out with me.
---
## BEN:
We gorged ourselves, we fought, we drank, we drank more.
---
## BEN:
I could’ve sent him home, I didn’t.
---
## BEN:
Out from the Stratford pub hot and drunk and he steps outside and falls asleep in the snow.
---
## BEN:
I find him half an hour later and he’s…
---
## BEN:
The fever was already in him.
---
## BEN:
I could’ve…
---
## JOHN:
No, Ben…
--
release yourself from that.
---
## BEN:
I miss him.
---
## BEN:
I miss the fight, I miss the work.
---
## BEN:
I miss the world.
---
## BEN:
The one we had and loved is gone.
---
## JOHN:
No one can help the passing of time nor friends.
---
## HENRY:
That’s why this is so urgent.
---
## BEN:
Yes, yes, yes… “he lives on in art.”
---
## BEN:
I wrote your damn lines.
---
## BEN:
Take them and let me drink and bemoan time’s cruel reaping in the corner.
---
## BEN:
Unless of course you’d like to—?
---
## ALICE:
Not even a little.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you, Ben.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you, again and…
---
## JOHN:
Again.
---
## JOHN:
And again.
---
## BEN:
I tried to be brief.
---
## BEN:
I couldn’t.
---
## HENRY:
“To draw no envy Shakespeare on thy name,”
---
## HENRY:
“Am I thus ample to thy Book, and Fame;”
---
## HENRY:
“While I confess thy writings to be such,”
---
## HENRY:
“As neither Man, nor Muse, can praise too much.”
---
## JOHN:
That’s…
---
## ALICE:
Oh that’s really—
---
## BEN:
It’s good. I know. Keep on.
---
## ALICE:
“I, therefore will begin.”
---
## ALICE:
“Soul of the Age!”
---
## ALICE:
“The applause! Delight!” 
---
## ALICE:
“The wonder of our Stage!”
---
## BEN:
No no no, you’re doing it wrong.
---
## BEN:
“Shine forth, thou Star of Poets, and with rage,”
---
## BEN:
“Or influence, chide, or cheer the drooping Stage;”
---
## BEN:
“Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourned like night,”
---
## BEN:
“And despairs day, but for thy Volumes light.”
---
## BEN:
You’re welcome.
---
## BEN:
I’m going to be sick.
---
## HENRY:
Isaac, did you hear that?
---
## HENRY:
Brilliant.
---
## BEN: (offstage)
Bloody brilliant.
---
## ISAAC:
It was.
---
## ISAAC:
Perfect, it’ll be perfect.
---
## HENRY:
If we get it to your men today, how soon can we see the book?
---
## ISAAC:
Soon.
---
## HENRY:
How soon?
---
## ISAAC:
The front matter’s all that’s left.
---
## ISAAC:
The first few copies will have Timon instead of Troilus—
---
## ALICE:
What? Why?
---
## ISAAC:
Long story, the end of which is, thankfully, happy.
---
## ISAAC:
My father convinced Walley to let us publish *Troilus* after all.
---
## ISAAC:
All we have to do it dedicate the book to the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery.
---
## HENRY:
Dedicate it to whom?
---
## JOHN:
Who are they?
---
## ISAAC:
Now, they’re our dearest and most constant patrons.
---
## HENRY:
Like hell they are.
---
## ISAAC:
That’s what my father bought for Walley to drop his quarrel.
---
## JOHN:
We’re not writing a dedication to men who had nothing to do with this.
---
## ISAAC:
Which is why he wrote one for you.
---
## ISAAC:
“To the most noble and incomparable pair of brethren.”
---
## ISAAC:
And it’ll work.
---
## ISAAC:
And we’ll have our collection.
---
## JOHN:
What your father would not do to ensure his own profit.
---
## ISAAC:
Yes…
--
ironically, a career of pirating Master Shakespeare’s plays 
---
## ISAAC:
is going to pay to publish them as they should be.
---
## HENRY:
That man would have to die to not get what he wants.
---
## ISAAC:
In this case, he did both.
---
## JOHN:
What’s this?
---
## ISAAC:
Last night. 
--
In his sleep. 
--
As soundly as a monk.
---
## ALICE:
Oh Isaac, no.
---
## JOHN:
What do you mean?
---
## ISAAC:
His favorite writer, his biggest project.
---
## ISAAC:
And he didn’t live to see it in print.
---
## ISAAC:
I’m not sure if it makes me sad or serves him right.
---
## ISAAC:
Or both.
---
## HENRY:
Isaac. I am sorry.
---
## ALICE:
I’m so sorry.
---
## ISAAC:
Thank you.
---
## ISAAC:
Let’s finish it, shall we?
---
## ISAAC:
Let’s finish it.
---
---
## JOHN:
Well, done, son.
---
## JOHN:
Well, done.
---
## ISAAC:
This is the presentation copy only.
---
## ISAAC:
We’ll do another printing to insert *Troilus* and *Cressida* so this isn’t the final version, 
---
## ISAAC:
but I thought you’d want to see it.
---
## JOHN:
Anne…
--
Anne should see it.
---
## HENRY:
We could take it to her.
---
## MARCUS:
This copy should go to the register, actually.
---
## HENRY:
We’ll bring it back.
---
## JOHN:
Yes, I want her to know what we did, what all this was for.
---
## DERING:
Excuse me?
---
## ISAAC:
Yes? Yes, sir, how can I help you?
---
## DERING:
You don’t have any Ben Jonson, do you?
---
## ISAAC:
Ah, no, apologies, your lordship.
---
## ISAAC:
Down the street they do.
---
## DERING:
Right then.
---
## DERING:
Actually I just came from a play across town by, um, Master Shakespeare.
---
## DERING:
Splendid!
---
## DERING:
Do you have any of his plays?
---
## ISAAC:
We have an entire collection.
---
## ISAAC:
In folio. Such a handsome volume.
---
## ISAAC:
Our best work.
---
## DERING:
Good.
---
## DERING:
I’d like two.
---
## DERING:
Of the Shakespeare Collection.
---
## DERING:
One covered in fine leather and one simply bound for home performances.
---
## DERING:
Please?
---
## CRIER:
Three plays this week at the Globe Theatre!
---
## CRIER:
One lamentable tragedy of *King Lear*; 
---
## CRIER:
one excellent history of *King John*; 
---
## CRIER:
and the enchanting comedy *Much Ado About Nothing*.
---
## CRIER:
Three o’clock in the afternoon!
---
## CRIER:
A penny for the pit!
---
## CRIER:
One penny for a play today!
---
---
## ANNE:
Gentlemen, good day.
---
## ANNE:
My daughter tells me I am to present a good appearance for friends of William’s in my house.
---
## HENRY:
No need to trouble yourself, Milady Shakespeare.
---
## JOHN:
But friends of your husband’s indeed, God rest his soul.
---
## ANNE:
I hope he does rest in Heaven.
---
## ANNE:
He never did on earth.
---
## HENRY:
We know that indeed, milady.
---
## HENRY:
It’s Henry Condell and John Heminges come from London.
---
## ANNE:
Of course, I remember you.
---
## ANNE:
He spoke of you often in his last years here.
---
## ANNE:
And you were at the funeral, I recall.
---
## JOHN:
We were, yes ma’am.
---
## JOHN:
Of course we were.
---
## ANNE:
And you are here again.
---
## ANNE:
Tell us why, and please excuse my condition.
---
## ANNE:
I am not so well nor so young as you two.
---
## JOHN:
Oh, I am not your junior by many months, milady.
---
## ANNE:
Then my eyes are failing me worse than I thought.
---
## HENRY:
You look well enough from mine.
---
## SUSANNAH:
What do you want?
---
## ANNE:
What brings you all the way to Stratford, good sirs?
---
## HENRY:
We wanted you to see…
--
to be the first to see…
--
his work.
---
## ANNE:
Whose work?
---
## JOHN:
Will’s.
---
## JOHN:
We gathered his plays and printed them.
---
## ANNE:
Printed?
---
## ANNE:
All of them?
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
---
## HENRY:
Well…
---
## JOHN:
Henry.
---
## HENRY:
I hope you didn’t like *Pericles*.
---
## JOHN:
We’ll put it in a later book, all right?
---
## JOHN:
Your husband’s words meant the world to us.
---
## JOHN:
And we wanted you to see them first.
---
## HENRY:
To see that the life you let him live was lived a thousand times over in the souls he gave us with his pen.
---
## ANNE:
That’s it there?
---
## HENRY:
Yes, milady.
---
## ANNE:
Susannah.
---
## ANNE:
Ben Jonson wrote that?
---
## ANNE:
About Will?
---
## HENRY:
Yes, milady.
---
## JOHN:
And with minimal coercion.
---
## ANNE:
Those boys.
---
## ANNE:
They didn’t know brotherhood if it wasn’t a battle.
---
## SUSANNAH:
And fatherhood if it wasn’t at distance.
---
## ANNE:
*Susannah*.
---
## JOHN:
My dear, he only spoke of you with great gentleness in my presence.
---
## JOHN:
His pride was kept safe at home in Stratford he said.
---
## SUSANNAH:
I think he had enough to say without mentioning us.
---
## ANNE:
All right, girl, enough.
---
## HENRY:
Oh no, my dear, no.
---
## HENRY:
If you read it you’ll see he wrote so often of daughters.
---
## HENRY:
Heroines, great loves, great loss.
---
## HENRY:
Daughters all.
---
## JOHN:
We can leave you ladies, if you wish.
---
## ANNE:
Why would you?
---
## ANNE:
Where would you like to start?
---
## HENRY:
Start…?
---
## ANNE:
To read them.
---
## JOHN:
To *you*, milady?
---
## ANNE:
Well, they’re plays are they not?
---
## ANNE:
Which are usually performed.
---
## ANNE:
And I find myself with two fine actors in my presence.
---
## ANNE:
Don’t I?
---
## HENRY:
That you do, milady.
---
## JOHN:
Yes. I suppose you do.
---
## ANNE:
Very good, then.
---
## ANNE:
Use Susannah for the lady parts.
---
## SUSANNAH:
*Mother*.
---
## ANNE:
No one’s going to arrest you for it here.
---
## ANNE:
Where shall we start?
---
## ANNE:
At the beginning, I suppose.
---
## ANNE:
Which is…?
---
## JOHN:
*The Tempest*.
---
## ANNE:
Hmm, doesn’t that sound exciting?
---
## ANNE:
Go on then.
---
---
## JOHN:
Exeunt.
